"""SPOT: every door tile either derives a frame+leaf model or falls back to the flat slab.

The voxel door reads its own geometry out of the art (see tools/capture/door.py): bright and dark
pixel classes are frame and leaf, and which is which is decided by containment, not by palette.
That derivation is the whole feature -- if it silently stops matching a tile, that door reverts to
a slab and nobody notices, because a slab still renders.

This pins the outcome for every door tile on disk: how many derive, which ones do not, and WHY.
A tile moving between the two lists is the signal; the counts alone are not.
