"""SPOT: the surround band's hand-over invariant, mirrored from ZoneRenderer.gd.

The band replaces the old penumbra "bib", which failed for a reason arithmetic can catch:
its first surround row did not equal the zone edge it abutted. It started at a CONSTANT
(FROZEN_EDGE_DIM) over a DIFFERENT BASE COLOUR, and the two rows meant to match measured
1.8/1.45/1.48 apart -- a different factor per channel, so no alpha could fix it.

The new band answers both halves per-cell: the base is the edge cell's own floor material
repeated outward, and the alpha starts at that same cell's tone. This asserts the alpha half
and the mapping that makes the base half true. Pure arithmetic -- no Godot, no apps.
