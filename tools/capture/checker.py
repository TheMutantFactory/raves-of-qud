"""The Object Checker sweep driver (phase2-test-plan Workstream A).

Loads Qud elements ONE AT A TIME onto a clean stage (the mod's "check" command:
clear a rect at zone center, place the blueprint, park the player adjacent) and
verifies each — the deterministic rung below the zoo's chaos. Two data sources
per element, diffed against each other:

  * checker_stage.json — GROUND TRUTH: what the mod believes it staged
    (blueprint, stage cell, static Render tile/colours).
  * the wire snapshot   — what Qud actually published for that cell.

Wire-level checks (this file, no screenshots needed): the stage cell arrived,
the element carries art (tile or glyph), colours look like Qud colour codes,
and the wire tile agrees with the blueprint's static tile (loose — runtime
tiles may legitimately differ, so a mismatch is a WARN, not a FAIL).
Pixel-level congruence (same-turn Qud/Raves screenshot pair) hangs off
--shots: both captures are saved per element for the contact sheet /
mean-diff pass to consume.

USAGE (Qud running + bridge mod, in-game)
