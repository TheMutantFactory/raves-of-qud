"""Region-scoped parity scoring for capture-diff work.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Whole-frame (and even per-band) mean-diff is too noisy to adjudicate small UI
changes: the live playfield behind a status screen's scrim differs every run, and
that alone moved the Equipment tab's average by ~0.7 between identical builds —
larger than most deltas worth chasing. Worse, a naive "ink box" that includes a
cell's own border measures the BOX, not the sprite, and blur flatters a mean while
looking wrong.

So parity is scored per LEAF: a named region with a kind that says what to compare.

  image      only the sprite ink inside a cell — the frame is masked out
  frame      only the chrome lines — the sprite interior is masked out
  composite  the whole cell, both together (what the eye sees)
  ink_color  the MEAN COLOUR of the ink, position ignored — isolates palette
  geometry   the ink BBOX only, colour ignored — isolates size and placement

The last two exist because "is the text the right colour" and "is the sprite the
right size" are different questions from "do these pixels match", and a single
masked mean-abs-diff answers all three at once and so answers none of them
clearly. A leaf that scores 0 on ink_color and badly on geometry says "right
paint, wrong place" — which is the sentence you actually want.

Each leaf reports mean abs diff over the compared pixels, the ink bounding box in
both apps, and coverage, so a change can be judged on the thing it touched.

USAGE
  parity.py capture <node> <prefix> [--no-goto] [--no-fresh] [--stable-gap S]
  parity.py score  <spec.json> <qud.png> <raves.png> [--leaf NAME] [--json]
                   [--stable <qud2.png>]   ignore pixels the reference does not hold still
  parity.py bounds <spec.json> <img.png> [--leaf NAME]      # what a leaf sees
  parity.py mask   <spec.json> <img.png> <leaf> <out.png>   # eyeball the mask

The spec is data (reports/<date>/parity-<screen>.json) so new screens are a JSON
edit, not code. Leaf names are the same strings the highvisor gametree uses for
its per-leaf 1:1 scores.

--stable: Qud draws its status screens over the LIVE playfield, which shows through
the scrim and differs every run -- creatures move, tiles animate. That lands on the
list leaves as noise big enough to swamp the thing being measured (the same build
scored list_item 5.70 and 9.00 on consecutive captures with no code change between
them). Pass a SECOND Qud capture of the same screen and every pixel that differs
between the two is dropped from every leaf: what is left is the UI, which is what
these leaves are about. Cheaper and safer than blanking Qud's world, which has no
option for it and no obviously reversible lever in its render stack.
