"""Walk a FOUR-ZONE CORNER and check every neighbour is wearing the right fade.

    python3 tools/capture/zonewalk.py            # walk the corner, assert, report
    python3 tools/capture/zonewalk.py --steps 6  # more crossings

WHAT IT IS FOR
--------------
A departed zone fades from the edge it SHARES with the zone you are standing in
(ZoneRenderer._frozen_light): an edge neighbour fades along a whole side, a diagonal one only
from its corner. Which of those a zone is owed depends on where it sits RELATIVE to the live
zone -- so it changes as you walk, and a zone that keeps an old orientation is wrong in a way
that is easy to miss by eye: a lit band down one edge and a corner fade look similar until you
know which you should be seeing.

That is exactly the bug this was written for. The bake was guarded by a bake-once meta, so
walking SE -> S -> N left the SE zone still wearing the ramp it earned as an EAST neighbour of
the S zone. Daniel: "the SE zone is showing a light all around the zone, when it should just be
the corner." A corner is the case a single crossing never exercises, which is why the walk goes
around a corner rather than back and forth.

HOW IT CHECKS
-------------
Not from pixels, and not from the wire either: NEIGHBOURS ARE NOT ON THE WIRE. They live in the
client's own WorldStore, accumulated from zones the player has visited, so a snapshot carries
only the LIVE zone. What the check uses instead is arithmetic the ids already encode --
`JoppaWorld.<pa>.<pb>.<zx>.<zy>.<z>`, one zone step being 80 cells in x and 25 in y:

    expected offset = ((zx - live_zx) * 80, (zy - live_zy) * 25)

ZoneRenderer prints `[zonefade] <zone id> off=(x,y)` once per zone per re-bake, so the assertion
is that every zone's LAST bake matches the offset its id says it should have from where the
player is standing now. That is a stronger check than reading a reported offset back: it
verifies the offset arithmetic as well as the freshness.
