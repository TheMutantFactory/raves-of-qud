# Playbook: driving a legacy game from Godot (and reading it back)

A portable guide for the class of project Raves of Mud belongs to: **a Godot front-end / viewer /
test-harness layered on top of a game you can't rewrite** — closed source, a different engine, its
own render loop and input model. Caves of Qud (Unity/.NET) is the worked example here, but the
*problems* below recur for any target: an emulator, a Unity/Unreal/Godot game, a terminal roguelike,
a Flash/Air port, a native app. The specifics differ every time; the failure modes don't.

**In one line:** build a **Godot front end for a legacy game** using three separable systems — a structured
**data bridge**, a **rendering/capture** loop, and an **OS-level input harness** — and prove each one on its
own. Read this before starting a new target; it will save you the multi-day detours we already paid for.

## The mental model: three planes

Every "Godot ↔ legacy game" integration has three separable planes. Keep them separate; most pain
comes from conflating them.

1. **Data & command bridge** — a channel that carries state *out* of the game and commands *in*.
   The high-bandwidth, structured, reliable path. Build this first.
2. **Rendering & presentation** — two apps, two windows, one OS. Who renders when, and the fact that
   the OS only fully renders the *focused* window. This is where the surprising walls are.
3. **OS-input harness** — real synthetic mouse/keyboard at the desktop level. The *universal* fallback
   that reaches anything the bridge can't, and the thing that makes tests reproducible.

You will want all three. The bridge is fastest and cleanest but can't reach everything; the OS harness
reaches everything but is slower and coarser; rendering is what humans (and your captures) actually see.

### Start here (prove each plane once, in order)

Before building anything fancy, get one end-to-end signal on each plane — they're independent, so verify
them independently:

1. **One snapshot out.** Get the game to emit one piece of live state over the bridge (a socket line).
2. **One command in.** Inject one command (a move) through the game's *own* input queue and see it resolve.
3. **One capture.** Screenshot the game window — including while it's **unfocused** (the render wall).
4. **One OS fallback action.** Drive one UI element the bridge can't reach with synthetic mouse input.

If all four work, the hard unknowns are retired and the rest is building out. If one fights you, that's
your real project — and the section for it below tells you why.

---

## Plane 1 — the data & command bridge

**Prefer an in-game mod + a socket over screen-scraping.** If the game supports mods/plugins (Unity
games usually do), a small mod that opens a localhost TCP server is the cleanest channel. Frame
messages simply: `[4-byte big-endian length][UTF-8 JSON]`. One direction publishes per-turn/per-frame
snapshots; the other accepts commands.

**Threading is the trap — and a target can have MORE THAN ONE special thread.** The socket runs on a
background thread; the game's API must be touched only on the **target's safe game/event thread**, which is
**not necessarily the engine's graphics/main thread.** Raves proves the distinction: Qud runs its turn
logic on a dedicated background thread (that's where reading Zone/Cell/GameObject is safe and where even
`BeforeRenderEvent` fires), while Unity **graphics** calls must go to Unity's main thread — two different
threads. Get it wrong and you get silent no-ops, or crashes ("graphics device is null"), or heisenbugs.
- Receive on the socket thread → hand work to the **target's game/event thread** via its own marshaling
  primitive (a task queue, a per-turn/-frame event hook). Never call engine APIs from the socket thread.
- Then marshal **graphics/rendering API calls specifically** to the engine's main/graphics thread (in
  Unity via `uiQueue`) — a second hop. Reading game state usually does *not* need that hop.
- Find out which calls belong to which thread *the hard way costs a day* — see "main-thread-only APIs"
  under Plane 2.

**Inject commands through the game's own input path, not a reimplementation.** Don't try to
re-derive "move the player." Feed the game's existing command/input queue the same token a keypress
would produce. It resolves doors, combat, turn cost, everything, for free.
> *Qud:* `ConsoleLib.Console.Keyboard.PushCommand("CmdMoveN")` enqueues the exact event a keypress
> makes; the game loop dispatches it identically. Bonus: it's thread-safe and wakes a blocked input
> read (see focus, below).

**Stamp every message with a build id.** Mods often compile at game startup, so a redeploy is inert
until a restart, and you *cannot tell from the outside* whether your fix is live. Put a version string
in every snapshot and print it in your inspector. This single habit prevents hours of debugging code
that isn't running.

**Snapshot the state you need, structured.** Positions, inventory, tiles, flags — as JSON, not pixels.
Pixels are Plane 2; data is Plane 1. Keep them apart.

## Plane 2 — rendering, and the two-window focus wall

This is the plane that will surprise you, especially on macOS.

### The core fact: the OS only live-renders the focused window
A human can focus only one window. On macOS, a **non-focused (or occluded) window's render loop is
throttled or paused** — this hits *both* your Godot viewer *and* the legacy game. So "two windows
updating live, side by side" fights the OS directly. Whichever window isn't focused tends to freeze
its view. Internalize this before you promise anyone a live side-by-side.

### It's layered — diagnose which layer is stuck
"The window isn't updating" is at least three different bugs. Separate them:
1. **Logic/turn thread paused.** The game's simulation thread is gated on focus (e.g. a
   `while (!focused) sleep` loop). Commands queue but never process. *Symptom:* inputs "flush in a
   burst the instant you focus the window."
2. **Render loop paused.** The sim runs but the engine isn't drawing frames for the background window.
   *Symptom:* state advances (your bridge snapshot changes) but the window is frozen.
3. **Buffer/mesh not refreshed.** Frames draw, but the specific view (a tile grid, a camera) isn't
   recomposited from current state, so it redraws stale content. *Symptom:* part of the window updates
   (e.g. a message log) while another part (the map) doesn't.
4. **OS compositor won't present.** Even if you render, the window server may not composite an
   unfocused/occluded window's surface. *Symptom:* nothing you do in-process changes the on-screen pixels.

You cannot fix (4) from inside the app. You often *can* fix (1)–(3). Instrument to find which layer:
a frame/heartbeat counter that ticks only when the loop actually runs tells you 1 vs 2 immediately.

### Levers that help (know their limits)
- **"Run in background" flags** (`Application.runInBackground` in Unity) let the engine keep rendering
  unfocused — but they are frequently **main-thread-only**, so setting them from a background/logic
  thread silently throws. Marshal to the main thread. *This exact bug ate a day here:* the flag was set
  from the turn thread, threw, and a `catch {}` swallowed it, so it was never on.
- **Decouple present from vsync** (`vSyncCount = 0`): an unfocused window's present can stall waiting on
  the focused display's refresh; unlocking it lets it render (throttled — expect a low background fps).
- **Force redraws you own.** In *your* app (Godot) you control the loop: call `RenderingServer.force_draw()`
  on a throttle while `!get_window().has_focus()` to keep the viewer live when it's in the background.
- **Refresh the specific view each turn.** If frames draw but the map is stale, call the game's own
  "recomposite the screen buffer" routine after each command (from the correct thread) so the view
  reflects new state.

### The pragmatic answer when you hit wall (4)
Stop fighting the compositor. Instead:
- **Read back via on-demand capture** (next section) — this works regardless of focus.
- **For a human demo, use the OS-input harness** (Plane 3): clicking a window focuses it, which
  refreshes it. Or drive from a script and accept that the live surface is the *focused* window while
  the other is one click (or one capture) away.
> *Qud outcome:* the Godot viewer is the live surface; Qud's own map can't be made to present live while
> backgrounded on macOS, but its buffer is kept current so it repaints *instantly* on focus, and
> on-demand capture reads its true state any time.

## Reading state back: capture without being fooled

Two channels, use both:
- **Structured state** over the bridge (Plane 1) — cheap, exact, scriptable.
- **The rendered image** — because some things only exist as pixels (UI you don't have data for, "does
  it *look* right").

**Have the app screenshot itself.** OS screen-capture usually needs Screen-Recording permission you
won't have; both engines can capture their own framebuffer to a file (Unity `ScreenCapture`, Godot a
forced draw + viewport grab). Read the PNG from disk.

**The capture trap — this *will* mislead you.** `ScreenCapture`-style calls *force a render*, so the
saved image can look perfectly current **even when the live window is frozen.** We "verified" a fix
twice this way before the user's own eyes caught that the live window wasn't moving. Rule: **a forced
capture proves the buffer/state, not that the live window presents.** To judge the *live* window, either
look at it (or have the human look) or measure the render loop's actual frame rate.

---

## Plane 3 — the OS-input harness (the universal fallback)

When the bridge can't reach it — native menus, dialogs, inventory grids, an ability bar, a launcher —
drive the game like a human, with **real synthetic mouse/keyboard at the desktop level.** This reaches
*everything*, is deterministic, and (bonus) clicking a window focuses it, solving the demo-refresh
problem as a side effect. It's also the layer that makes runs reproducible across machines from a shared
seed.

Build it in-process (ctypes/FFI to the OS input APIs), not by shelling out — a spawned helper (e.g.
`osascript`) is a *separate process* with separate permissions and will fail where your host succeeds.

### macOS specifics (the ones that cost time)
- **Accessibility permission** is required to post synthetic input (not for reading window geometry or
  sending Apple-Event "activate"). Grant it to the **process that actually runs your code** — which may
  be a *helper bundle*, not the app you think. Here the responsible bundle was the lowercase `claude`
  claude-code helper, **not** the main `Claude.app`, and **not** the confusingly-named top-level
  "Accessibility" settings pane (that's assistive *features*; you want **Privacy & Security →
  Accessibility**). Check the real state with `AXIsProcessTrusted()`, not a proxy. It took effect live,
  no restart — but be ready to relaunch the host if it doesn't.
- **Synthetic input is target- AND surface-specific — there is no universal click recipe.** Start with a
  minimal warp + down/up. Add an explicit `MouseMoved`/hover event, or a `kCGMouseEventClickState` field,
  **only when readback proves that surface needs it** — some controls require them and others *reject* them
  (in Caves of Qud a Sprint button accepts both, but world cells reject a pre-move and Qud clicks reject
  click-state). See highvisor's verified per-surface matrix (highvisor `docs/05-driving-input.md`) as the
  concrete case study. And **successful event posting is not proof the app reacted** — always capture/read
  back after the action.
- **App names differ per API.** The window-list *owner* name, the AppleScript *application* name, and
  the process name can all differ (Qud: owner `CavesOfQud`, app `CoQ`). Resolve an alias per call.
- **Target by fraction, not pixels.** Get the window rect, then click at `(x + fx*w, y + fy*h)`. This is
  robust to window position, resolution, and Retina scaling (a 2× capture maps 1:1 to the logical
  window in fractions). Multi-monitor coordinates are global and can be negative.

### The loop that ties it together
`capture the game's render → locate a UI element's fractional position in the image → click that
fraction of the live window → re-capture → confirm the effect.` That is your reproducible harness, and
the base for parallel/seeded runs. *(Verified here by clicking the Sprint button: "You begin sprinting!",
move-speed 100→200.)*

## Reverse-engineering the legacy target (don't guess — read the binary)

You will need to know internal names, gates, and hooks the game never documented. Decompile and reflect;
verify against the actual shipped binary.
- **.NET / Unity:** `ilspycmd` (decompile a type to C#) + `System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext` over
  the game's `Managed/*.dll` (self-contained; core assembly = `mscorlib`). This is how we found the
  focus gate (`while(!GameManager.focused) Thread.Sleep`), the input queue (`Keyboard.PushCommand`), the
  render path (`RenderBase → DrawBuffer`), and the buffer→screen blit (`GameManager.OnUpdate`).
- **Other engines:** the analogue exists (Il2CppDumper/Ghidra for IL2CPP or native, `javap`/CFR for JVM,
  symbol tables for native). The principle is constant: **find the exact symbol and verify it against the
  running build**, rather than pattern-matching on a guessed name (`ColorUtility.CAMERA_BACKGROUND` was
  not the world background; `RenderTile` was reasoned about for rounds before a field proved it never fired).
- If the modding path supports it, patch libraries (Harmony) let you hook methods cleanly — but check
  platform support (**Harmony patching is blocked on macOS** for this target, which forced watchdog-thread
  workarounds instead of clean patches).

## A checklist for a new target

When you start a new Godot-on-legacy-game integration, work through these:

- [ ] **Modding hook?** Can you load code into the game? If yes → in-game bridge. If no → you live
      entirely in Plane 3 (OS input + screen capture) and read state from pixels.
- [ ] **Bridge up:** localhost socket, framed JSON, build-stamped snapshots, command injection through
      the game's own input path. Verify with a position round-trip.
- [ ] **Threading mapped:** which calls are main-thread-only? What's the marshaling primitive? Never
      touch engine state off the game thread.
- [ ] **Focus behavior probed:** does the game render/process while unfocused? Instrument a heartbeat.
      Identify which of the 4 layers stalls.
- [ ] **Viewer stays live unfocused:** force redraw in your Godot app when `!has_focus()`.
- [ ] **On-demand capture** for both apps; remember the forced-capture trap when verifying.
- [ ] **OS-input harness:** in-process synthetic input; Accessibility granted to the *right* process;
      clicks carry move+ClickState; fraction-based targeting; per-API app-name aliases.
- [ ] **Reverse-engineering toolchain** ready (decompiler + reflection) and a build-stamp habit so you
      always know what's running.
- [ ] **Verification discipline:** capture-and-confirm every fix; never trust "it should work"; watch for
      the capture that lies about the live window.

## The meta-lesson

The multi-day detour on this project was trying to force an unfocused macOS window to present its 3D
map — a wall the OS owns. The productive move was to **stop fighting rendering and build the OS-input
harness**, which made the original goal (drive + verify the game for development and human testing) not
just possible but *better*: deterministic, reproducible, and able to reach every corner of the game's UI.
When a plane fights you past the point of reason, check whether a different plane gets you the actual
outcome you wanted.
