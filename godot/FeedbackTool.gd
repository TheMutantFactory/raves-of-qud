## ELEMENT FEEDBACK — Cmd+Right-click any UI element to name it and file feedback on it.
##
## The point is a feedback loop on the UI itself: a tester Cmd+Right-clicks the thing that looks
## wrong, sees what Raves calls it ("title · Continue"), types a note, and it lands in a file the
## team can read — one JSON line per note in <support>/feedback.jsonl.
##
## THE FILE IS AN OUTBOX, NOT A DESTINATION. Reports are POSTed to Brand.FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT by the
## FeedbackSubmitter this builds in _ready, and a line is deleted only once the server has taken
## it — so an offline session, a captive portal or a dead endpoint costs nothing but a delay. The
## envelope is the feedback-service contract (schema/envelope.v1.md in that repo): `v`, app,
## app_version, platform, install_id, ts, then the per-product fields.
##
## Scope rules:
##   - the HOLODECK PLAYFIELD is not an element. Cmd+Right-click there stays the tile inspector's
##     gesture (inspect + photograph both apps) — any hit node carrying meta "feedback_skip"
##     (MainFrame sets it on the play hole) falls through untouched.
##   - while the form is open it is MODAL: every input is consumed, Esc cancels, Cmd+Enter saves.
##     UiState reports popup="feedback" so `hv assert --popup feedback` can see it, same contract
##     as the game popups.
##
## Element naming: the deepest visible Control whose global rect contains the click, walked by
## hand — Godot's own hover resolution skips MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE nodes, and most of our display
## leaves ignore the mouse (the command-bar rule), so asking the picker would name a container
## three levels up. A node's display name is its scene-tree name when hand-given, else its own
## text (a Button's caption is its best name), else its class; the display path is the scene plus
## the last two meaningful names, the record carries the full raw path too.

## the mouse. Paint order matters because whole screens ride CanvasLayers: the status screens draw
## on layer 90 over MainFrame's layer-0 chrome, but MainFrame's tree is DEEPER, so a deepest-wins
## walk named the chrome BEHIND the status screen — and when the deepest thing behind was the play
## hole, its feedback_skip silently handed the whole gesture to the tile inspector.
##
## Ordering: higher CanvasLayer wins; within a layer, later document order wins (later siblings
## draw on top, and a child draws over its parent — which also preserves the old deepest-wins
## behaviour for lineal chains). z_index and top_level are not modelled.

## `path` cannot do this job and never could. Godot names anonymous nodes `@Class@<instance>`,

## twice came back as `.../StatusScreens/@Control@6773` and `.../StatusScreens/@Control@265`, and
## 95 distinct auto-names appeared for a handful of real nodes. Two users reporting the same
## button produce different paths; so does one user across two launches. Dedupe, "14 people hit
## this", and per-element history all collapse on that. The path stays in the record because it
## is useful when debugging ONE report locally — it is just not an identity.
##
## `element` cannot do it either: it embeds live text, so it drifts with game state and is where
## character names and world strings leak into a payload that leaves the machine.
##

##   1. the nearest ancestor (or the element) carrying a `feedback_id` meta wins — the same idiom
##      as `feedback_skip`/`feedback_pass`. Put one on anything you want to track by name across
##      redesigns; the tree can then be rearranged under it without breaking the key.
##   2. otherwise the ancestor chain with every auto-name collapsed to its bare CLASS. Derived
##      from tree SHAPE, so it survives relaunches, machines and builds that do not restructure
