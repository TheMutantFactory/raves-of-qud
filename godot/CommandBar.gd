# STATE TAGS, sampled off Qud's own ability bar (Sprint driven through off / on / cooling over
# the bridge, glyph cores read per pixel column). The arguments are Qud's SCREEN values, wrapped
# in q8 — which pre-compensates RAVES' canvas shader so a value survives it intact (drawing
# q8(148)=158 measured back as 148 on screen). Do NOT feed q8 a Qud PALETTE source: that
# double-counts a curve Qud has already applied — the palette's `g` is (0,148,3), but what Qud
# actually puts on the glass is (3,123,6), and the glass is what we are matching.
#
# The lift matters most where it is least obvious. Drawn raw, the near-black brackets came back
# DIMMER than Qud's (they fell out of a sum>115 pixel scan entirely) while the bright grey word
# matched fine — Raves' shader compresses the dark end hardest, which is the end q8 lifts.
#
# Peaks vary ±8% between captures of the identical tag (glyph AA lands differently by subpixel
# position), so treat anything inside that as matched and don't chase it.

#
# Two things the old single-tone constants could not say:
#  1. Qud colours the BRACKETS separately from the body — the same near-black green either way —
#     which is exactly what Daniel reported ("the brackets look dark green and 'on' is closer to
#     the rectangle selecting Sprint").
#  2. `on` is a SATURATED green, not a mint. The old #59d38a carried a lot of blue; Qud's green
#     measures blue = SIX, which rules out the mint and the palette's bright `G` alike.

## (96,161,176)). The old #6cb7c8 was a lone brighter blue. This was the open colour question in

## The BOX we give the ability icon. Its rendered INK came out 34 tall against Qud's 40 -- the
## sprite is fitted into the box with KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED and the box's own aspect, not the
## nominal size, decides the scale. 47 lands the ink at 38 against Qud's 40 and is the LIMIT: at 50

## amber. Sampled per glyph in the same frame as the state tags — (189,189,189) and (193,193,193)
## for `<` and `>`, (127,111,77) for the `1` between them. The flat #929393 that used to cover the
## whole tag split the difference and got both wrong: too dark for the chevrons, colourless for
