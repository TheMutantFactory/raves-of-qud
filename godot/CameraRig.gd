extends Node3D

## The Holodeck's camera rig — extracted from Main. Owns the `_pivot` + `_cam` (Camera3D) nodes, all
## camera modes/state/consts, and the per-frame placement math. Main feeds it the player position each
## snapshot and routes camera input to it; it drives where the eye sits and what it looks at.
##
## STAGE 1 of the Main.gd decomposition: this holds the state + math + nodes. Main still owns input,
## the snapshot step/cross detection, the mode label, the debug menu, multiview, and settings, and it
## reaches into this rig's members for those (later stages move those seams behind methods). Fields the
## outside touches are left un-underscored where practical; the pure-internal helpers keep their `_`.
##

##   COMPASS (default, cardinal-locked), FOLLOW, FIRST_PERSON, CINEMATIC, MOUSE, KEYBOARD, TOP_FOLLOW.
