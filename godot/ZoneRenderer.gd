## Renders a zone snapshot:

##   wall (IsWall)            -> merged into ONE greedy-meshed rock mesh per zone
##   otherwise                -> upright billboard sprite (plants, creatures, items)
## Walls are greedy-meshed: adjacent wall cells become a single mesh with merged
## top faces, only exposed side faces, and real normals — so a lit material makes
## the rock read as carved 3D instead of flat cubes. Tiles are 2-colour masks

## How bright REMEMBERED ground stays. MEASURED OFF QUD, not chosen: Qud barely darkens remembered
## ground at all, because its memory is a PALETTE SWAP of the glyphs (&K/k) and a cell is ~99.7%
## background (tile-dirt1.png is 1 opaque pixel in 384) — so the background it swaps nothing about
## dominates. Native captures of the same zone: lit field rgb(17,53,52), remembered rgb(15,45,44),
## a ratio of 0.85. This value is that ratio through the overlay: alpha = (1-f)*DARK_MAX = 0.15.
##
## It was 0.35 (alpha 0.61, near-black ground) on the strength of screenshots taken while Raves was
## stuck in 1:1 mode, where _build_darkness returns before doing anything — so every reading that
## drove it, including the request to go darker, described a render this constant never touched.
const MEMORY_GROUND := 0.84
## THE VISITED-ZONE HAND-OVER TARGET (2026-08-23): a zone you have BEEN IN no longer ramps to
## black — it ramps to the exact darkness alpha the LIVE zone gives an explored, out-of-sight
## cell (tone 1-MEMORY_GROUND times its DARK_MAX amax). Daniel: "I'd like the other zones to be
## lit like they're in the zone, but hidden by the line-of-sight fog." Equal BY CONSTRUCTION,
## not by tuning — the bib taught never to compute a colour twice and hope the copies agree.
## Zones never visited keep the old look: the surround band still ramps to full black.
const MEMORY_TARGET := (1.0 - MEMORY_GROUND) * DARK_MAX
## Qud's LightLevel.None. At or below it a cell is not perceived at all and renders as the K/k
## ghost; ABOVE it Qud draws full colour, with nothing in between (Cell.Render). The number was
## spelled `1` in three places that each had to re-explain what it meant.
const LIGHT_NONE := 1
## Qud's LightLevel.Light — a cell a light SOURCE reaches, as opposed to one a SENSE reaches
## (Darkvision 10, Safelight 30). A ground pool is drawn from this and not from `> LIGHT_NONE`:
## with night vision on, half the zone clears that lower bar and the pool would fill the screen.
const LIGHT_LIT := 200

## How bright NEVER-SEEN ground stays — the fog of war. Qud's own answer is "no darkening at all":
## a histogram of its playfield contains 0.00% near-black pixels (max channel < 12), because Qud
## paints CAMERA_BACKGROUND across the whole 80x25 stage and simply draws no glyphs on cells you
## have not seen. Its darkest real ground is rgb(11,33,33) — still the field family, and that floor
## is its LIGHT gradient, which Raves models separately through this same overlay.
##
## So the fog is not a colour of its own, it is the field seen dimmer. This sits a little under
## MEMORY_GROUND so the frontier is still legible in 3D, where the camera shows far more of the
## world at once than Qud's stage does; 1.0 would be literal Qud. Raves drew it at black (f = 0.0,
## alpha 0.94) before, which is the one thing Qud never does.
const FOG_GROUND := 0.70

## THE ZONE YOU LEFT, fading with distance. Daniel: "the zone you left ... shaded as if they were
## no longer in the line of sight ... the edge row a little dim and fully dark by 4 tiles in. It's
## the same as if a building or something is in the way."
##
## The ramp is measured from the LIVE zone's boundary, not from the player: what matters is how far
## past the edge of what you can see a cell sits. FROZEN_EDGE_DIM is the row butted against the live
## zone, and the darkness reaches full by FROZEN_DARK_IN tiles in.
const FROZEN_EDGE_DIM := 0.18   # alpha on the row touching the live zone — just off clear
## RADIUS in tiles, and STEPS PER TILE, both from Settings so they can be tuned and preset without
## a rebuild (the committed `penumbra-3x1` fixture is the tile-resolution baseline).
##   radius     3 -> the fade spans 3 tiles and is fully dark on the 4th
##   divisions  1 -> one flat step per tile. Higher subdivides WITHIN the tile; 16 puts a step on
##              every pixel column of Qud's 16x24 art, which is as fine as the tile can render.
## Subdivision is AXIS-AWARE: a cell in an edge band only varies along one axis, so it costs D
## sub-quads rather than D squared. At D=16 that is 23k quads for a zone's band instead of 231k —
## the difference between a knob you can turn and the overdraw crash this file already documents.
var penumbra_radius := 3
var penumbra_divisions := 1
## ...and the LIVE zone fades toward its own edges, so the world does not simply stop at a hard
## line. Daniel: "the current zone should always fade out in all cardinal directions." The
## outermost row lands on FROZEN_EDGE_DIM — the same value the neighbour's first row carries — so
## the two halves meet at one brightness and the seam reads as one continuous fade rather than two
## ramps that happen to be adjacent. Clear again LIVE_EDGE_FADE tiles in.
const LIVE_EDGE_FADE := 4

## THE TWO RAMPS ABOVE ARE OFF, and stay off. They were the first design for the boundary — the
## "bib" — and what killed them is worth keeping, because it is not a tuning story.
##
## Both land on FROZEN_EDGE_DIM at the shared boundary, which was meant to make the two halves meet
## at one brightness. They meet at one ALPHA. That is not the same thing: each side applies that
## alpha over a DIFFERENT BASE. Measured at the Joppa north boundary at night, straight down a
## column of open ground —
##
##     the frozen side ramps  (0,1,2) -> (9,32,40)   brightest at the row touching the live zone
##     the live side is flat            (5,23,28)
##
## — so the two rows meant to be equal differ by 1.8/1.45/1.48, a different factor per channel. No
## single alpha produces that, because darkening cannot reconcile two different bases: the live
## floor is painted-ground tile art under the night grade, the frozen side is remembered art, and
## past a loaded neighbour it was the bare field plane. Three materials, one ramp.
##
## MEASURE AT NIGHT. The daylight check that once said the seam matched could not have failed —
## in full daylight there is barely a penumbra to get wrong.
const ZONE_RAMPS_ON := false
## THE REPLACEMENT, and it is on: the surround band in _build_unexplored, which stops computing a
## colour for the ground outside the zone and repeats the edge cells' own ground quads outward,
## darkening from each edge cell's own tone. Base and alpha both matched per-cell, by construction.
## Read the note on _build_unexplored for how it works; this is the switch that turns it off.
##
## It replaces the ramps rather than joining them. The live zone must NOT also fade toward its own
## edges: the band already starts at the edge cell's brightness, so an inward fade on top would
## darken the zone you are standing in for nothing — which is the "(0,24) my character seems to be
## in discovered fog-of-war" report that gated _live_edge_light on line of sight in the first place.
const SURROUND_BAND_ON := true
## THE DEPARTED-ZONE BRIGHTNESS CAP IS GONE, superseded by _frozen_tone. It tried to hold a
## remembered zone no brighter than the live one by raising its TONE, and it never showed on glass:
## capping the alpha cannot reconcile two different bases (memory's flat K #155352 against live art
## under the night grade measured 2.8/1.92/1.96 apart at equal tones), and solving for the alpha
## analytically needs the live ground's luminance, which the modal colour string overstates 3.3x
## because what renders is dark line-work tinted by that string. Both are the same lesson the bib
## taught: stop computing the colour. _frozen_tone sidesteps it by not needing either side's
## colour -- it starts the departed zone at the MEASURED tone of the live cell it abuts.
const CAP_QUANT := 16.0
## How far along the edge the band will borrow a ground quad when its own source cell has none.
##
## A cave's zone edge is mostly SOLID ROCK, and a wall cell has no floor quad to lend: measured
## across four underground zones, the 206-cell ring held ground for only 24, 23, 4 and 13 of them.
## An unbounded search then dragged one distant patch of floor around the whole boundary. Three
## cells is "the same bit of terrain, just past a gap"; beyond that the honest answer is that there
## is no ground here, and the band says so by going solid (see the bare branch in _build_unexplored).
##
## This is also what made the band inconsistent across zone transitions before _edge_floor was
## cleared in _build_static: the ring kept whatever the PREVIOUS zones had left in it, so a fresh
## cave's band was painted with the last surface zone's dirt, and which cells inherited depended on
## where that zone's walls had fallen. Daniel: "the bibs are very inconsistent when transitioning
## zones." The cache is cleared now, which is why these counts finally read the truth.
const BAND_BORROW_MAX := 3

## Above this alpha a darkness quad is drawn OPAQUE instead of blended. Not cosmetic — it is what
## makes the frozen-zone ramp affordable. A full sheet of alpha-blended quads over every neighbour
## is the thing that crashed in _platform_memmove (see _build_darkness), and the ramp would be
## exactly that if its solid interior blended too. Past the ramp every cell is FULLY dark, and
## "fully dark" needs no blending — it is a black surface. So the blended fill stays capped at the
## FROZEN_DARK_IN-deep band along the shared edge whatever the zone's size.
const DARK_SOLID_A := 0.995
## Alpha difference across a cell below which subdividing it cannot change the picture: a vertex
## colour is 8-bit, so anything under 1/255 quantises to the same byte. The gate that turns a
## 256-quad gradient back into one quad (see _veil_bounds).
const FLAT_ALPHA := 1.0 / 255.0
## THE MEMORY WASH. A remembered cell is not "the floor, dimmed" — in Qud it is the FIELD, because
## a cell is ~99.7% background and memory only repaints the sparse glyph in K/k. Measured on Qud at
## dusk: its playfield is the field colour throughout, with water showing only as a lighter teal
## stipple, never as blue. Painting the field colour gets there without touching the floor batches,
## which are MultiMeshes keyed by material — a per-cell swap would mean splitting and rebuilding
## them every turn as sight changes. This is the overlay quad that was already being emitted, in a
## different colour, with the ordinary darkness still laid over it for the remembered dimming.
##
## How completely the memory wash covers a remembered cell. Not 1.0: a trace of the real floor
## showing through is what keeps a remembered river reading as a river-shaped thing rather than
## flat ground, which is also what Qud's sparse K/k glyphs do.
const REMEMBER_COVER := 0.92
const DARK_FLOOR_Y := 0.07      # darkness quad sits just above the floor tiles
const DARK_ROOF_Y := WALL_H + 0.02   # and just above wall roofs, to dun unlit rock tops
## FULLY-DARK ground sits at FLOOR height, like every other darkness quad.
##
## Raising it above the sprites was tried, to stop trees and grass glowing out of a region that is
## meant to be unseen, and it works — but it trades one artifact for a worse one: an opaque plane a
## metre off the ground can be seen UNDER, and at any oblique angle a bright strip of untouched
## ground plane appears along the whole boundary. Measured at both WALL_H + 0.6 and WALL_H + 0.02;
## the strip is there either way, because the camera does not have to be far off the horizontal to
## get beneath it.
##
## So the unexplored surround (which has no assets to expose — those zones are never loaded) is
## clean at floor height, and a VISITED zone's far side still shows its plants through the dark.
## Fixing that needs the sprites hidden rather than covered, which is per-cell work on a frozen
## subtree that nothing currently tracks.
const DARK_SOLID_Y := DARK_FLOOR_Y
## The least a departed zone's object may be dimmed to. NOT zero: Daniel, after the first version
## hid them outright, "we should see the tents, just dark." A thing in the fog is still a thing you
## remember is there, and Qud's own memory is a dim palette rather than a deletion — so the far end
## of the ramp is a silhouette, not an absence.

## for it at 64x64. Ask for it at ONE TEXEL PER CELL and turn filtering off, and each texel IS a
## cell. No second falloff function to keep in step with the first, and the smooth pool stays
## available (\_glow_tex) if the look is ever wanted back.
##
## ALIGNMENT IS THE WHOLE JOB, and it comes down to one parity rule. A quad of D units centred on
## cell (cx, cy) puts texel i's centre at cx - D/2 + i + 0.5. With D an ODD integer that is
## cx - (D-1)/2 + i: an integer offset from the cell centre, so texel centres land on cell centres
## and the seams land on cell boundaries. With D even every texel straddles two cells and the pool
## is a half-cell out in both axes -- which looks like a bug and is very hard to see as one.
## Z-STRETCH does not disturb it: the renderer node scales Z, and cells are scaled with it, so the
## alignment holds in the local space where cells are unit squares.

## light on the floor and the light in the fog cannot disagree.
##
## Keyed in PLACED coordinates (cell + offset), the same ones _place_light is handed, because a

## Per-cell darkness overlay (cavern lighting). ONE vertex-coloured MIX-black mesh: a quad
## over each cell's floor (and its roof, for wall cells) whose ALPHA is how DARK the cell is
## (1 - light). Built into _dynamic_root each turn, so it tracks Qud's live light map as
## sources/player move. Cheap — one mesh, and fully-lit cells contribute nothing. The
## additive torch/glow geometry draws bright on top, so lit pools read against the black.
## `parent` is where the one darkness mesh lands: _dynamic_root for the live zone (rebuilt
## each turn, tracks moving light) or a neighbour's frozen subtree (baked once from that
## zone's remembered light, so remembered zones darken to match instead of staying lit).
##
## THERE IS NO SIGHT-DISC CLEAR. A zone the player had left used to force f = 0.0 for every cell
## within FROZEN_LIGHT_CLEAR_R = 7 of the departure point, meaning to erase the bright pool Qud
## lights around the player — which would otherwise hang in a departed zone as a cropped light.
## But f = 0.0 is not "no light", it is FULL DARKNESS (alpha 0.94 of black), so it erased that
## hanging light by punching a hole in the exact shape of it. Daniel: "when you leave a zone,
## there is a negative light cone where you had a positive light cone." 6.3% of the playfield
## near-black across one crossing; 0.0% once removed.
##
## DO NOT re-solve the leftover bright pool with an `if frozen: f = minf(f, MEMORY_GROUND)` here.
## It is the obvious next move and it CRASHES: every neighbour zone then carries a full sheet of
## alpha-blended quads, and zooming out with several on screen dies in _platform_memmove, 3 runs
## of 3. Run-length merging the quads does not help — it cuts vertices, not blended fill — which
## is the tell that this is the overdraw failure mode in CLAUDE.md. A frozen zone's memory look
## has to be baked into its OWN geometry, the way walls get _ghost_wall_mesh, not laid over it.
## `frozen_off`: for a zone the player has LEFT, its cell offset from the live zone. Turns on the
## distance ramp (see FROZEN_EDGE_DIM). Left at the sentinel for the live zone, which has no
## boundary to fade from.
## The FLAT part of a visited zone's memory film, ROW-RUN MERGED. Emits, for every cell whose
## band depth exceeds `fringe`: the field-colour wash + a MEMORY_TARGET darkness run (explored),
## or a FOG_GROUND darkness run (unexplored), plus per-cell roof quads on walls (sparse — and
## without them a wall top past the ramp is the one lit thing in the zone: "rusted metal wall
## visibly red", again). `fringe = 0` takes the whole zone (every frozen cell has depth >= 1);
## the near zones pass penumbra_radius + 1 so the hand-over rows stay on the per-cell path.
## Run merging is the load-bearing part: per-cell blended sheets over every neighbour are the
## documented _platform_memmove crash, and the flat interior is one quad per run instead.

## A DEPARTED ZONE'S TONE, by the SAME hand-over rule as the surround band.
##
## This is the north edge in Daniel's NE-corner shot: east was a band (correct, smooth) and north
## was a loaded neighbour, and the difference was two hard terraces — the live zone at tone 0.0,
## the departed zone at a flat 1 - MEMORY_GROUND = 0.16, then black where the data runs out.
## Daniel: "the eastern edge of the zone is correct. The northern edge is not."
##
## A flat memory tone cannot avoid that step, and neither could the ORIGINAL frozen ramp, which
## started at the constant FROZEN_EDGE_DIM: a constant meets the zone's actual edge at whatever
## brightness the hour happens to give it. So the frozen side now starts where the BAND starts —
## at the tone of the live edge cell this one sits beyond, per-cell, via the same _band_alpha —
## and ramps to full dark over the same radius. One rule, two sides of the boundary, so they
## cannot disagree; and both sides answer it with a measurement rather than a constant.
##
## Note there is NO memory floor here. A remembered cell renders at MEMORY_GROUND everywhere else,
## but the rows immediately outside the live zone are the hand-over, and holding them at 0.16 is
## exactly the step being removed. Qud never draws these cells at all — it shows one zone — so
## there is no parity to lose, only a seam to close.
## RETIRED 2026-08-23 (extra-zone view, third calibration): both callers are gone — a visited

## THE WORLD YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TO — and the band that hands the live zone over to it.
##
## Everything outside the zones you have visited is otherwise the ground plane at full field
## colour, a bright expanse running to the horizon: the one part of the view that does not answer
## to the fog. Daniel: "change the unexplored zones to be the same dark colour as unexplored tiles
## ... but don't expose any of the unexplored zone's assets." Nothing here draws a zone — the
## unexplored ones are not loaded and this does not load them.
##
## THE BAND EXTENDS THE EDGE CELLS' OWN GROUND QUADS OUTWARD, which is the rebuild of the "bib"
## after the first design was removed. The old one painted a black ramp over whatever happened to
## be underneath — the bare field plane out here, painted-ground tile art inside the zone. Two
## different bases under one alpha, so the row that was supposed to match the zone's edge came out
## 1.8/1.45/1.48 brighter, a different factor per channel, and no amount of tuning the alpha could
## reconcile it (see ZONE_RAMPS_ON for the measurements).
##
## So the band stops computing a colour. Each surround cell clamps to the nearest cell inside the
## rect and repeats THAT cell's finished floor material (_edge_floor, captured where the quad is
## batched) at its own position, then darkens from THAT cell's tone (_edge_tone). Both halves of
## the match are by construction and both are per-cell, so the hand-over holds where the edge runs
## from sand into water, and at every hour, without a constant anywhere in it. Repeating a material
## costs a MultiMesh transform, not a texture.
##
## Beyond the band it is solid and opaque (see DARK_SOLID_A) — a handful of big rects with the
## band's footprint cut out of them. A loaded neighbour draws its own zone AND its own darkness, so
## its slot is skipped entirely: where there is real data, show real data.

# --- torch / fire light ------------------------------------------------------

## An additive warm glow on the ground (the "light") plus a small flickering flame
## Is this object ON FIRE, read off Qud's own render animation?
##
## Qud has no "burning" flag on the wire, but it does not need one: a Flaming object's
## RenderEvent flickers, and the mod sweeps 60 frames of that into `animSched` already (see
## AnimFrameSweep). Burning comes through as a COLOUR-ONLY schedule — no tile ever changes —
## whose entries pair a fire foreground with a flashing cell BACKGROUND:
##
##     60|0=;&r^k;|1=;;|2=;&r^k;|7=;&r^W;|11=;&r^W;|12=;&r^k;|...
##
## which is red-on-black alternating with red-on-white and plain frames between. Reading the
## animation rather than adding a flag means this works for EVERY burning thing Qud renders, not
## just the player — the Mechanimist pilgrim who catches light beside you smokes too — and needs
## no mod rebuild, which matters because deploying one costs a full Qud restart.
##
## Deliberately narrow. `^` alone is not fire: Asleep floods `^c` behind its art the same way. The
## foreground has to be a flame colour AND a background has to flash, and it has to happen on at
## least two distinct frames, or a single steady tint would qualify.
## THE FLICKER IS IN THE BACKGROUND, NOT THE FOREGROUND. This first read the foreground for a
## flame colour, which worked on two characters and silently failed on a third: the foreground is
## the CREATURE'S OWN colour and has nothing to do with being on fire. Three real captures, all
## burning —
##     &r^k / &r^W     a Wanderer
##     &Y^k / &Y^W     the same character later
##     &G^k / &G^W     a level-44 character, and the one that exposed it
## — vary in the foreground and agree exactly in the background: Qud flashes the CELL white and
## back as the thing burns. So the test is the background alternating W and k, and the foreground
## is not looked at at all.
const FIRE_BG_FLASH := "W"      # the flash
const FIRE_BG_BASE := "K"       # ...and what it flashes back to (matched case-insensitively)

## Is this creature ASLEEP, read off the same render sweep as burning? Asleep is Qud's cyan
## program: a ^c background flood, and — on the LIVE shape — a frame swapping the whole tile to a
## Text/ glyph, the floating "z". Two real captures, and they do not agree:
##
##     60|0=;&c^c;|10=;;|20=;&c^c;                        (archived; two floods, colour-only)
##     60|0=;;|11=;&C^c;|25=;;|36=Text/95.bmp;&c;|45=;;   (live farmer, in his bed, 2026-08-23)
##
## THE SWEEP IS A WINDOW, NOT THE ANIMATION. The mod records 60 frames of RenderEvent per
## snapshot, and the sleep program's phases drift across that window — so the SAME sleeping
## farmer sweeps to different shapes on different turns. Three real captures of one effect:
##
##     60|0=;&c^c;|10=;;|20=;&c^c;                        floods only
##     60|0=;;|11=;&C^c;|25=;;|36=Text/95.bmp;&c;|45=;;   flood + z glyph
##     60|0=;;|36=Text/95.bmp;&c;|45=;;                   z glyph ALONE (the same farmer,
##                                                         minutes after matching the shape above)
##
## The detector was tightened to each specimen in turn and a later sweep of the SAME creature
## walked through it — "he was flat for a few turns, now he's back up and flashing." The honest
## rule is the program's alphabet, not a phase count: every animated frame must be a ^c flood or
## a Text/ glyph (anything else is another animation), and at least ONE of either must appear.
## Burning wins ties. And because a window can also catch NOTHING, _asleep_now remembers.

## wall bracket. Daniel: "the fire is only in one place on the body, let's spread it around" and

## Tongues are drawn TALLER than they are wide. A square particle reads as an ember; the same

## the camera either way. Daniel: "can we make the particles flame vertically a little more?"
const BURN_FIRE_TALL := 1.7
## Emission volume: roughly a body. The Y extent is what spreads flame UP the creature instead of
## pooling it at the feet — the emitter sits at BURN_FIRE_Y, so tongues start anywhere in the box

## Tighter than it was (0.30 cubed). The wide box spread flame across the whole tile, which read
## as a bonfire the creature happened to stand in rather than a body alight. Narrow in X and Z so

## climbed four tiles, so the plume slowed at the top. It measured exactly as designed (density
## piled up across tiles 1-4 and fell off a cliff above) and looked wrong doing it: decelerating
## particles bunch, and a bunch reads as a lid on the column rather than smoke thinning out.
## Daniel: "let's make the smoke particles keep rising, the slowdown looks not good." Rising all
## the way and fading on the colour ramp's alpha is what smoke does — it does not stop, it stops
## being visible.
const BURN_SMOKE_SWAY := 0.75       # against 0.28 — it spreads WIDE as it climbs
## Tight. A column reads as ONE plume off one body only while the particles stay grouped; born
## across a wide footprint they read as several small fires. Narrow here and narrow in `spread`
## below — the width the plume does gain should come from the wind carrying it, which is coherent,
## rather than from scatter at birth, which is not. Daniel: "make the smoke rise faster and group

## Applied as the particle system's GRAVITY, which is otherwise zero for smoke. That gives a
## constant sideways ACCELERATION, and against the plume's damping it settles into a steady lean:
## the column still leaves the body vertically and bends downwind as it climbs, which is how smoke
## actually behaves. A fixed velocity offset would shear the whole plume sideways from the first
## frame instead, wind-sock rather than smoke.

## variation in each row." The row's prime sets its base; each mote then takes a speed anywhere from
## a third of that base to a little over it. The band is deliberately ASYMMETRIC — it reaches far
## below the base and barely above — so a uniform roll inside it puts most motes under the base.
## That is the weighting, without a second emitter per band: mean lands at about 0.72 of the base.
##
## The old ±6% was not variation, it was a rounding error. A row read as one speed.
const DUST_BASE_COLOR := Color8(0x15, 0x53, 0x52)   ## Daniel's pick

## THE GUST: one slow oscillation for the whole zone, so the wind rises and falls as weather rather
## than blowing at one strength forever. Daniel: "a combo LFO made of primes that speed up/slow
## down all the dust in a zone at once. It should transition slowly. Like 10-20 seconds."
##
## PRIME PERIODS, for the same reason the rows carry primes: four sines at 11/13/17/19 seconds sum
## to a waveform whose own period is their product — 46189 seconds, thirteen hours — so the wind
## never repeats a pattern anyone could sit through. Each component is inside the 10-20s he asked
## for; it is the SUM that is long, and nothing computes it.
##
## The transition is slower than the LFO looks, and for free: changing initial_velocity only
## affects motes emitted from now on, so a gust eases in over a mote lifetime (5s) as the old
## population blows out. The wind changes like wind, not like a slider.
const DUST_LFO_PERIODS := [11.0, 13.0, 17.0, 19.0]
const DUST_LFO_DEPTH := 0.45     ## +-45% on the whole zone at the extremes

const DUST_ROW_SLOW := 0.35      ## a mote can be this fraction of its row's base speed...
const DUST_ROW_FAST := 1.10      ## ...or this much of it, and no faster

## ONE PRIME PER ZONE ROW, and they are the row speeds' RATIOS, not multipliers of a base.
##
## Daniel: "use prime numbers to create natural patterns that don't repeat. Use a different base
## number for each zone row. Can you figure out something workable, or are the numbers too big?"
##
## They are not too big, because NOTHING EVER EVALUATES THE PERIOD. Two rows whose speeds are
## distinct primes fall back into step only after p_i * p_j lifetimes; across 25 rows the whole
## field realigns after the product of all 25, about 1e32 lifetimes. "Never repeats" is therefore
## free at runtime — it is a property of the choice of numbers, not something computed.
##
## The real constraint runs the other way: a prime cannot MULTIPLY a base speed, or row 25 would
## blow three times faster than dust has any business moving. So the primes are mapped through as
## ratios inside the speed band — row speed = TILES_MIN * p / p[0] — which keeps p_i/p_j exactly
## and lands the band at 2.00 .. 5.70 tiles. That is the reason for choosing 25 primes spanning a
## ~3x ratio (67..191, ratio 2.851): the ratio of the SET is what sets the top of the band, and it
## had to match the 2..6 tiles the effect was specified with.

## THE HAND-AUTHORED DOOR. Daniel modelled a frame and a leaf in MagicaVoxel and asked to use them
## in place of the shape derived from the tile art. Returns false when there is no file, and the
## caller falls through to the derived door, which stays the default for every other tile.
##
## The file names its parts, so this reads "door" and "frame" rather than guessing by model order.
## Its two palette colours are read as ROLES, not as literal paint: Qud's own k (#0f3b3a) is the
## field colour and marks the doorway's cap, everything else takes the object's main colour. That
## keeps a door yellow when Qud says `&y` — baking the grey in would make every door in the game
## grey, and the whole reason the art path tints rather than blits is that Qud recolours per object.

## The waterwheel: a 12-PANEL cylinder turning on an east-west axle.
##
## Daniel: "The waterwheel is a cylinder with the faces going east-west ... let's try and make
## the UV map for the sides and faces" / "12 panels sounds great".
##
## THE MILL FIXES THE AXIS before the art gets a vote: the E-W axle run at (3,7)..(5,7) ends at
## the wheel's cell (6,7), and a wheel drives the axle along its OWN axis. The old standing rule
## ("ORIENTED PANEL running E-W (faces N/S)") is 90 degrees off — a guess from before there was
## a mill to check it against.
##
## So the tile is the wheel seen EDGE-ON, which is why its wood pattern TRANSLATES vertically
## between frames rather than rotating about a centre. That single observation decides which of
## the two maps is real: the art hands us the TREAD directly and says nothing whatever about the
## END, so the face is built from the tread's own colour and panel count. Columns split the tile
## three ways — 1..8 wood only (the wheel, half a cell thick), 9..12 every detail pixel (water
## falling off the east side, NOT wheel surface, not modelled here), 13..14 the far frame.
##
## tools/capture/wheelmap.py is the same derivation with a preview sheet; change one, change both.
const WHEEL_PANELS := 12

## Profile radii, as fractions of the disc: the hub the radial lines cross at, and the inner
## edge of the rim hoop. The filled slices live between them.
## Angular widths inside one slice, as fractions of it: the radial wall, the water lying on it,
## and the lip that retains the water. Daniel: "add a layer of blue water on the spokes. In the
## direction of rotation, the layer would lay flat on the spoke. Also, try and add a lip counter
## to the direction of motion to 'hold the water in'." Spoke + water + lip is a BUCKET: the wall
## is its floor, the lip its outer wall, and the water sits between them.

## The endcap ring is DASHED — six arcs with background between them (Daniel: "add Qud bg color
## to the blue ring at intervals to divide the blue ring into 6 sections. Like a dashed line
## perimeter."). Six divides the twelve vanes, so a gap lands on every other one instead of
## drifting against the structure. It also gives the face 6-fold symmetry where a continuous
## ring had rotational INVARIANCE — which is what makes the wheel look like it is turning again
## when you are square on to it.

## Half again what the tile measures. A wheel derived at its art size is 0.92 of a cell across,
## so hung on the axle line its lowest point sits ABOVE the surface and the thing spins dry
## (Daniel: "otherwise it won't dip into the water"). 2.0 put 18% of the wheel under; 1.5 —
## where Daniel settled it — puts the lowest 7% under, so it still breaks the surface but reads
## a good deal less monumental.

## How far the whole mill assembly hangs below FLOAT_Y. Daniel: "drop the height of the
## waterwheel, the axels, the hole in the gearbox. I'd like the wheel to dip into the water,
## but it's already at aesthetically max size" — so the dip comes from lowering the axle line
## rather than from growing the wheel again.
##
## Applied to EVERY part of the machine, which is the only way it can be applied: wheel, shafts
## and the gearbox's opening share one line, and dropping the wheel alone would pull its hub off
## the shaft it turns. 0.2 puts the wheel's lowest 17% under water at 1.3x — the submersion 2.0x
## used to give, at the size Daniel wants.

## The wheel as TWO END DISCS held apart by its radial walls.
##
## Daniel: "keep the entire circle on the waterwheel endcaps. Let's only extrude the radial
## lines. That means the circle is only present at the endcaps. Like two pizzas held together
## by 6 intersecting walls."
##
## So a pixel on a radial line (a spoke, or the hub they all cross at) becomes ONE box running
## the whole thickness, and every other disc pixel — the rim band above all — becomes two thin
## slabs, one at each end, with open air between them. The rim therefore reads as a hoop at each
## face rather than a drum, which is the whole point: the cylinder's round side is gone and what
## is left is the drawing, twice, with structure between.
##
## Culling: a full-depth box tests its in-plane neighbours against the RADIAL profile and an end
## slab tests against the WHOLE disc. That pairing is what keeps it hole-free — an end slab
## beside a spoke is correctly buried (the spoke's box covers that depth), while a spoke beside
## a rim-only pixel still draws its long side, of which only the slab's depth is hidden.

## One half-shaft as an I-BEAM of voxel blocks, spun about its own axis.

##
## That replaces three baked meshes swapped on a schedule with ONE mesh turned continuously,
## which is what the art was depicting all along: Qud's frames are a cylinder's markings at
## three phases, and a section that is not rotationally symmetric gives real rotation for
## free. The notches are what make the turn legible — a square prism spinning looks static.
##
## The web takes the background colour rather than a darker wood, so the beam reads as open
## between its flanges, matching the gearbox's recess trick.
##
## Built in SHAFT-LOCAL space, centred on the origin, so the driver can spin it by writing a
## basis; length runs on the CELL's scale (a half spans half a cell and meets its neighbour),
## thickness on the ART's, which is the same split the flat shaft used.

## every time the character turned around.
##
## THE FLAME COMES FROM THE ART. _flame_band reads the torch's own bright pixels; the emitter sits
## at the BOTTOM of that band and is scaled so its rise covers exactly the band's height. So the
## fire is on the burning end of the stick at whatever size the stick is drawn, and a torch with a

## THE BURNING PART OF A TORCH, read off its own art.
##
## A lit-torch tile is two materials: the SHAFT in the object's main colour and the FLAME in its
## detail colour. Qud's masks encode that as luminance — dark pixels take main, bright pixels take
## detail (see _recolor_rgb) — so the flame is exactly the bright band, and on Items/sw_torch_lit
## that is rows 3..12 with the shaft running dark from 12 down to 20. No hand-written row numbers
## and no per-tile table: a different torch with a taller flame reports a taller band.
##
## Returns the bright pixels' BOUNDING BOX in tile coordinates, or a zero-size rect when the art has
## no bright pixels at all — an unlit torch, where the honest answer is that nothing is burning.
##
## The BOX and not just the rows, because the flame is off to one side on a diagonal torch (columns
## 6..15 while the shaft runs down to column 1): clamping the fire to the burning rows but leaving

# Which transparent pixels are INSIDE the art rather than around it.
#
# The tile itself can't tell us: alpha is strictly binary, and the RGB left under
# transparent pixels is atlas bleed from neighbouring tiles (it appears in rows
# entirely outside the sprite, and visually identical gaps carry different
# colours). So the test is geometric — a pixel is interior when the art spans it
# BOTH vertically in its column and horizontally in its row.
#
# Why not a border flood fill, the textbook answer? Qud art often has a
# transparent separator line that reaches the tile edge — the chest has one under
# its lid — and a flood fill drains the whole interior out through it, leaving
# you seeing the world through the middle of the chest. Span testing never asks
# about connectivity, so a leak can't propagate.
#
# Known limit: a sprite whose interior SHOULD stay see-through (a basket you look
# into) is geometrically indistinguishable from one that shouldn't. No rule here
# separates them. Note Qud's own 2D view shows the cell background through that
# interior too, so filling it matches the game.

## they bake their own shading into the vertex colours (the face table: 1.00 broad, 0.92 top, 0.72
## rim, 0.50 underside). The voxel-WALL material is SHADED_WORLD-lit, and lighting a
## flat sheet by orientation made an east-west tent read darker than a north-south one
## for no reason the player can see (Daniel). The fabric's old art quads were unshaded
## too, so a tent looked the same whichever way it ran; per-cell light still lands via
## the light_frac the vertex colours are multiplied by.
var _vox_skin_mat: StandardMaterial3D

## A voxel prop's mesh, wearing its OWN skin material so the cell's light can move.
##
## THE LIGHT OF THE MOMENT A PROP WAS BUILT IS NOT ITS COLOUR. The tent, the signpost and the
## waterwheel each multiplied `light_frac` straight into their vertex colours and then wore the
## SHARED skin material, which pinned every one of them to whatever the cell happened to be lit
## like at build time -- for good. A tent built while its cell was dark stayed black through dawn,
## through the player walking up to it with a torch, through everything, and Qud went on reporting
## the cell as lit and in sight the whole time. Daniel, on a canvas one step away from his
## character: "Canvas is dark. Like it's in fog or darkness."
##
## So light rides where _fence_half_vox already puts it: vertex colours carry the ART and the face
## shade, a per-instance material's albedo_color carries the light (it multiplies vertex colour),
## and the instance goes in _lit_meshes so the per-turn pass can move it. DUPLICATE, never the
## cached material -- _reset_static_light writes albedo_color straight onto material_override, so
## one shared material would hand every voxel prop in the zone the last one's light.
##
## Registration buys the MEMORY GHOST too: _lit_meshes swaps a vertex-coloured mesh for its K/k
## variant when the cell is out of sight, which is the treatment walls and sprites already get and
## the one Daniel asked for on the tents ("we should see the tents, just dark").

## Cache key for an object's colours — the painted rgb when present, else the
## colour codes. Must distinguish the two, or a painted and an unpainted object
## sharing a tile would collide in the texture cache.
## BLOOD (and any staining liquid) PAINTED ONTO THE SPRITE ITSELF.
##
## Daniel, on the bloodied creature: "it's a flashing red sprite, facing the wrong way, with the
## wrong size. Let's just red paint drips to the existing sprite."
##
## What it was: Qud's RenderSmearPrimary flashes a liquid-covered thing in the liquid's colour for
## 9 frames in 60, and Raves reproduced that as a SEPARATE overlay quad wearing a recoloured copy
## of the tile. A second quad is a second set of answers to where-does-this-face and how-big-is-it,
## and it got both wrong: the billboard carries the object's own pixel_size, tree scale, hflip and
## seat, while the overlay is a 1x1 plane hung at the layer height. Nothing about that is fixable
## by nudging the overlay — the only copy that is guaranteed to match the sprite is the sprite.
##
## So the stain goes INTO the texture. Same image, same size, same facing, same seat, by
## construction, and no flash: a bloodied thing is bloodied, not blinking.
##
## The drips are DETERMINISTIC per tile+colour (the RNG is seeded from the cache key), because this
## texture is cached and reused across every creature wearing it — a per-frame roll would shimmer,
## and two dromads stained by the same pool should not be arguing about where the blood ran.
## HOW MUCH RED ACTUALLY LANDS. The first pass lerped each pixel toward the stain at 0.85 falling
## to 0.35, which on a dark sprite under a dim cell light came out as a few brown dots — Daniel,
## looking at it: "I need red on the character sprite." A stain is PAINT: the head of a run is the
## liquid's colour outright, and only the tail lets the art underneath show through.
## HOW DEEP AN ARCHWAY IS, in art pixels. The first pass extruded it a full cell (16px, the tile's
## own width) on the reasoning that "extend to the wall" meant as deep as the wall — Daniel:
## "the arches need to be about 8 pixels deep, not the whole tile. Same height. Same artwork. Just
## not extruded as much." So it still MEETS the wall on both faces, it is just a thinner piece of
## it: an archway is a doorway in a wall, not a tunnel through one.
##
## Read as a fraction of the tile WIDTH, like the door's frame depth, so it stays 8/16 of a cell
## whatever the art's pixel dimensions turn out to be.
const ARCH_DEPTH_PX := 8.0

const DRIP_HEAD := 1.0        ## the top of a run is pure stain
const DRIP_TAIL := 0.55       ## ...and the bottom still reads as stain, not as a tint

## COATING LIQUIDS GET A LOT MORE OF IT. Daniel, stuck in a pool of asphalt: "let's work on the
## tarred coloring. It's like the blood drip but a lot more. It's also asphalt colored."
##
## Blood spatters; tar COATS. Same painter, different amount: every column carries a run, the runs
## go the whole way down, and the tail stays nearly as dark as the head — which is what a thing
## pulled out of an asphalt pool looks like, versus one that has been bled on.
##
## Keyed on the smear COLOUR CODE, which is the only thing the wire carries about the liquid, and
## which happens to group them the right way: 'K' is asphalt, ink, oil, ooze and putrescence — all
## of them things that coat — while 'r' is blood and stays a drip. 'w' (sludge, honey, cider) coats
## too; cider is the odd one in that set and is not worth a wire change to separate.
const COAT_CODES := ["K", "w", "G", "g"]     ## asphalt/ink/oil/ooze, sludge/honey, goo, slime
## A LOT MORE, NOT EVERYTHING. The first attempt ran every column the full height at full strength
## and turned the figure into a black rectangle with the missed pixels reading as noise — the worst
## of both, neither a coated creature nor a streaked one. "Like the blood drip but a lot more" is
## more RUNS and LONGER runs, not the end of the silhouette: tar sheets off a thing, and you can
