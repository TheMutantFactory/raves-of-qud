## Reusable CHARACTER-CREATION "card row" screen — the shared template behind Qud's guided chargen
## steps (Choose Game Mode, Choose Genotype, …). One horizontal row of dashed-frame cards on Qud's
## dark ground, with the sheaf emblem + "character creation" + a ":choose …:" subtitle above, the
## selected item's flavour text below, "[R] Randomize Selection", the nav hint, a top-left breadcrumb,
## and left/right page arrows. All the extracted-sprite chrome (frame, emblem, arrows, ornament) and
## the icon-recolour/selection machinery live here; a subclass supplies the DATA + a few strings by
## overriding the hooks in the "SUBCLASS HOOKS" section.

## Side-nav ("[Esc] Back" / "[Num 9] Next"), measured off Qud's caste screen. Three distinct
## colours, where Raves previously used MUTED for everything and a guessed DIM:
##   arrow, enabled  (66,100,112) — the same steel as the breadcrumb icons
##   text,  enabled  (177,201,195) — QudPalette y
##   either, disabled (15,59,58)  — QudPalette k, all but invisible
## Qud's Next reads disabled on arrival because nothing is confirmed yet; its Back is always live,
## so the Back reading is the one that is not confounded by state — and Raves was drawing it at
## (97,124,120) against Qud's (177,201,195).
const NAV_ARROW := Color8(0x42, 0x64, 0x70)   # Qud (66,100,112) — same value as CRUMB_ICON
## The three-dot deco under the description. Its own steel, bluer than both MUTED (97,124,120) and
## the nav/crumb steel (66,100,112) — not a palette entry, so it is recorded as measured.
const DECO_KNOB := Color8(0x5B, 0x7A, 0x8A)   # Qud (91,122,138)
## How far a card NAME may spill past its column on each side before wrapping. Qud's names overflow
## their cards freely — "Horticulturist" is 118px over a 97px card — and 10 each side is what makes
## "Priest of All Suns" break in two like Qud's rather than three. Costs no layout width; see the
## wrapper in _build_card.

## Qud's colour codes -> RGB. QudPalette.COLORS is the canonical table and always was; this file
## carried its own hand-approximated copy that had drifted badly, and since the same table colours
## every screen, every parity comparison was carrying the drift.
##
## Measured on THIS screen's arcology band rules at 1920x1080: Qud draws the Ibul band (96,162,174)
## where the local copy drew (97,245,245), and Yawningmoon (168,64,14) where it drew (244,75,75) —
## generic bright ANSI colours against Qud's muted set. Three entries were the wrong hue family
## outright: R is ORANGE, not pink-red; k/K are dark TEAL, not grey; y is green-tinted bone.
##
## Confirmed first-party rather than assumed: `hv bridge dumpcolors` calls Qud's own
## ColorUtility.colorFromChar for every code (mod: ColorsExporter) and the export agrees with
## QudPalette exactly, so the wiki transcription it was built from is correct.
const QUD_COLORS := QudPalette.COLORS

## Qud draws its chargen text SMALLER than the app's own scale. Measured by column-profiling the same
## strings in both apps at 1920x1080: "character creation" spans 284px in Qud against 330 in Raves,
## ":choose caste:" 127 against 142 — the same ratio on the genotype screen as on Choose Caste, so it
## is one scale for the whole chargen flow rather than a per-screen nudge. 0.87 lands the title at
## 287 and the subtitle at 124.
##
## Applied as a THEME rather than per-label font sizes, which UiFont's contract forbids: the sizes
## still come from UiFont.px() and still track window height, this subtree just reads them at 0.87.
## It is also what stops long card names wrapping — "Horticulturist" only overflowed its frame
## because it was being drawn 15% too wide.

func _category_bands() -> Array: return []

## Vertical layout, as fractions of viewport height. These are HOOKS rather than constants because
## the banded screen is not the unbanded one shifted by a fixed amount: inserting the header row moves

## Card width and inter-card gap, as fractions of viewport WIDTH. A hook because the row does not
## simply stretch with the item count: Qud fits twelve castes into much the same span it gives five
## game modes by drawing them narrower and tighter, so a screen with a long row supplies its own
## measured pair rather than inheriting the five-card one.
func _card_w_frac() -> float: return 0.049
## Card HEIGHT as a fraction of viewport height. A hook for the same reason the width is one:
## Qud's starting-location cards carry a 5x3 map thumbnail and are far taller than the figure

## How far ABOVE the selected card the big selection frame reaches, as a fraction of viewport height.
## On an unbanded screen Qud runs it up to the subtitle line; on Choose Caste there is an arcology
## row in that space and Qud's frame stops short of it, so the banded screen tightens this rather
## than drawing its highlight straight through a header.
