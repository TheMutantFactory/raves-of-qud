##
## TWO RENDERS, one per mode:
##
## USER (QoL): computed CLIENT-SIDE from the snapshot's cells + player position — objects within
##   RADIUS, deduped by (stripped) display name, showing the NEAREST one's arrow, its recoloured
##   TILE image, and a ×count. Sorted nearest. This is the variant Daniel likes; leave it alone.
##
## 1:1: Qud's own rows, shipped by the mod from XRL.UI.ObjectFinder (snapshot key "nearby") and
##   drawn to Qud.UI.ObjectFinderLine's layout — see the geometry block below. The content CANNOT
##   be derived here: Qud's accept test is a seven-rule classifier chain over objects that already
##   passed ShouldShowInNearbyItemsList(), which for a solid cell defers to CanInteractInCellWithSolid.
##   That is why Qud lists two takeable items where this panel's own scan listed a wall and a path.
##
## NOTE: the whole-zone scan (RADIUS = zone size) is the basis for the future Points of Interest menu.
