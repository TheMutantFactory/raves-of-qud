extends Control

## MAIN GAMEPLAY FRAMING — the chrome around the whole gameplay view.
##
## This is ROUGH framing only: real Control chrome (status bar, vitals, menus, command bar) with
## PLACEHOLDER data, plus labelled placeholder CELLS for the sub-views that each get their own Godot
## scene later (the Holodeck, minimap, nearby-objects, message log, …). The layout is five stacked
## rows; row 3 (the Holodeck + side panels) expands to take the free space, split by a draggable
## "grabby" separator.
##
## Built in GDScript (like Main.gd / OnboardingControl) so the .tscn stays a single node. Fonts come
## from the one source of truth, UiFont — the root theme propagates to every child Control here (no
## CanvasLayer in between, so it just inherits). Press F12 to drop a screenshot next to the others.
##
## NOT wired to Qud yet — it runs standalone so the layout can be iterated fast. Placeholder values
## are illustrative; the real bindings arrive with each view.

# Chrome colours from Caves of Qud's canonical palette (see QudPalette.gd / wiki Visual Style). Inlined
# as literal Colors so they stay compile-time consts; codes noted in comments.
const COL_HUNGER := Color("e99f10")           # O — hunger / food-orange
const COL_THIRST := Color("0096ff")           # B — thirst / water-blue (water is also currency)
const COL_HP := Color("00c420")               # G — HP bar green
const COL_EXP := Color("40a4b9")              # c — LVL/EXP bar (dark cyan)

# User mode keeps the bright COL_HP / COL_EXP above.

# (measured off the top bar: R≈G≈B, glyph core ~161, peak ~180 → ≈ #b0b0b0), a touch smaller than

# darker and greyer than ANY tile-palette colour — the 18-colour palette is for the game WORLD, not the
# chrome. So the world/clear stays palette k (the play area samples to k), but the panels use that
# near-black. (Earlier k-for-panels read too green; K #155352 read as a bright teal box.)

## brightness — measured mean RGB (138,164,164) cool vs (157,151,140) warm — so Qud says
## "toggle state" with HUE and never says "unavailable" at all. Its Up/Down buttons carry no
## ActiveButton and no disabled sprite; pressing Up with no stairs just fails in the log. So
## this dim is Raves' own vocabulary, kept clear of Qud's two hues by being a dim.
const NAV_DIM_ALPHA := 0.4

## Grey the Up icon in zones with no way up (Daniel's feedback).
##
## A KNOWN, DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE FROM QUD. Qud never dims this icon: only WindowLock / Finder /
## Minimap carry an ActiveButton, and even those say "toggle is on" with hue rather than
## brightness — Up/Down have a single sprite and no state at all. Dimming was still the right
## call because this cluster IS the 1:1 chrome (user mode shows the verbose text row instead), so
## gating it to user mode would have made the feature unreachable. Expect a small top-bar parity
## delta in zones with no stairs up; it is this feature, not a regression.
##
## The click stays LIVE. A dimmed control that silently eats its click explains nothing; sending
## CmdMoveU lets Qud answer "There are no stairs up here." in the message log, the same answer the
## keyboard gives — the dim is a hint, not a gate.
##
## Down is deliberately untouched: descent has affordances stairs don't cover (digging, falling),
## so "no StairsDown here" is not "you cannot go down" — and Joppa, which has no way up, ships
## stairsDown TRUE, so the two really are independent. The mod sends both flags, so wiring Down
## is a one-liner if that turns out to be wrong.

## own camera / environment / bridge in _ready, so it just works. Mouse over the hole passes through to
## Main (inspector); keyboard reaches Main via _unhandled_input. Camera/movement (polled input) works
## regardless. Two explicit stages so the (now-unlikely) 3D crash can't take the data with it:
##   1. Connect (data) — instance Main with render_3d = FALSE. The bridge starts and the status bar +
##      panels fill with ZERO 3D build work (Main skips the whole build/render path). The empty 3D
##      world (just sky) shows in the hole. Proves the data layer independent of the 3D.
##   2. Turn on viewport — set Main.render_3d = true, which builds + renders the current zone into the
##      root viewport. No SubViewport, so no separate Metal render target to overrun.
