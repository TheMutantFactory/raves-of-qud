class_name PopupOverlay
extends CanvasLayer

## Mirrors a Qud modal popup that the mod forwarded over the bridge — message, Yes/No, an option list
## (PickOption), or a text prompt (AskString). While visible it is MODAL: it consumes keyboard input in
## `_input` (which runs before the Holodeck's `_unhandled_input`), so movement / wishes don't leak through.
## The viewer's answer is emitted as `answered`; Main relays it as a "popup" command, which invokes Qud's
## own popup callback and unblocks the turn thread the real popup is parked on.
##
## Answer payloads (→ mod PopupBridge.HandleCommand):
##   {"action":"button","btn":<command>}   dismiss with a bottom button (Accept/Yes/No/Cancel/…)
##   {"action":"option","index":<i>}        pick option i from a PickOption list
##   {"action":"input","text":<s>}          submit AskString text

signal answered
## Emitted whenever the modal leaves the screen -- answered here, or dismissed by Qud.
## Screens behind it use this to refresh: an item action only lands when the viewer
## ANSWERS, so that is the moment their data is stale, not when the menu opened.

## QUD'S POPUP BOX MODEL — ported whole, 2026-08-08, from the live RectTransforms
## (`uiprobe target=PopupMessage`) of four popups: three item menus of 7/8/9 options and
## widths 239.81/278.21/433.61, plus the wish AskString (650x76.72, no context header).
## Every number below is Qud's own; nothing here is fitted to a capture.
##
##   PopupMessage   1920x1080 VerticalLayoutGroup, align MiddleCenter, no padding
##     MenuControll spacing 10, pad L20 R20 T0 B5 -- THE BOX. Qud CENTRES this, and the
##                  visible chrome hangs off it (see below); it does not centre the chrome.
##       ContextContainer  spacing 10, pad T10, MiddleCenter
##                         = 10 + tile 72 + 10 + name 20.12 + 10 + divider 16 = 138.12
##       [PolatFrameSuperHeader 20]      the title row -- AFTER the context block
##       Scroll View / Content  spacing 2, pad L5 R5
##                         = Message + 2 + options area + 2 + inputbox
##                           options area = 26 per row, spacing 2
##       MenuCrome         20 tall, spacing 5, pad L-20 R-20 (so it spans the WHOLE box)
##
## Verified arithmetic (probe vs model, both popups): 138.12 + 10 + 224 + 10 + 20 + 5 =
## 407.12 = the probe's MenuControll h, and y = (1080-407.12)/2 = 336.44 = the probe's y.

# …and WITHOUT any: 15, the bare height of the two line sprites. Qud's death screen is the
# case -- it offers four options and no bottom commands at all, so its MenuCrome holds only
# `--|` and `|--`. Measured off Qud's own MenuControll (uiprobe target=PopupMessage):
# 5 padB + 10 spacing + 172.34 content + 15 = 202.34, against the 207.36 a fixed 20 gives.
# That 5px went into the box height, and a centred box turned it into every option row

## MenuCrome's two line sprites stretch, but they have a MINIMUM of 25 -- and that minimum
## can size the whole popup. Qud's quit confirm is the case that shows it: its message only
## asks for 383.40 of content, its three entries for 393.40, and the box comes out 453.40 =
## 393.40 + 2 spacings + 2 lines at their 25px floor. No other kind reaches it, which is
## exactly why the box model had to be checked against a yes/no and not only a menu.
const CROME_LINE_MIN := 25.0
## THE TITLE ROW (Qud's `PolatFrameSuperHeader`). 20 tall, spacing 10, pad L-20 R-20, and
## its two edge assemblies have a 10px minimum -- so its minimum RECT is exactly its
## Header's own text width, and on a popup with nothing wider that is what sizes the box.
##
## Qud's header text is the SAME face and size as its body text (probe: SourceCodePro-
## Regular SDF, 16, on both) and still measures wider, because a header advances 0.67em
## where body text advances 0.6em. That is not fitted to this popup: the journal header's
## shipped widths already gave `16.079*len - 1.66` at size 24, which is 0.67em advance
## less the 0.07em the last glyph does not spend, and the same model predicts
## 0.67*16*17 - 0.07*16 = 181.12 for "Select Controller" against a probed 181.13.

## Cap on a rule break: 2 wide x this tall, centred on the 2px rule. Qud draws a small
## SQUARE here (measured 4 tall, y319-322 against a rule at y320-321), not a tick. The
## [Esc] Cancel rule at the bottom is NOT capped this way -- it keeps its own 1px end
## ticks down the sprite's full height, which is what Qud draws there.
const CAP_H := 4.0
## A rule break is capped on BOTH sides, and the two are not the same width. MEASURED off
## Qud's divider 2026-08-09 (box x821-1098 w278, rule y471-472), every cap dy -1..+2:
##   offsets 63-64   (2 wide)   end of the segment that reaches the box's LEFT edge
##   offsets 72-75   (4 wide)   start of the segment heading for the centre
##   offsets 202-205 (4 wide)   end of that segment on the other side
##   offsets 213-214 (2 wide)   start of the segment reaching the RIGHT edge
## So the cap facing the box EDGE is 2 wide and the one facing the CENTRE is 4 -- the same
## square the ornaments' strokes terminate in. We drew only the 2-wide pair, so each break
## was capped on one side and ran off square on the other.
##
## Anchored to l1 / r0 -- the same values the segments are drawn from -- rather than to
## measured offsets, so the caps rasterise with their own segment instead of drifting from it
## if the box width changes.
const CAP_W_INNER := 4.0


## The emblem does not stop at the top rule -- three strokes carry on BELOW it, each ending
## in the same small square the rule breaks use. The extracted emblem PNG covers only the
## part above the rule, so these are drawn.
##
## MEASURED off Qud 2026-08-09 (cloth robe popup, box x821-1098 w278, rule y320-321). Every
## stroke starts at y322, immediately under the rule:
##   left    stem x132-133  y322-330 (9 tall)   cap x131-134  y327-330
##   centre  stem x138-139  y322-332 (11 tall)  cap x137-140  y329-332
##   right   stem x144-145  y322-330 (9 tall)   cap x143-146  y327-330
## i.e. 2px stems on a 6px pitch centred on the box, each capped by a 4x4 square at its FOOT,
## with the middle stroke 2px longer. Same square the rule breaks terminate in, which is why
## it reads as one family rather than three loose ticks.

## THE ROW'S OWN SPRITE. Qud fills QudMenuItem.icon for menus whose entries are THINGS rather than
## verbs — "Go to which point of interest?" ships a tile for every creature and object in the list —
## and then draws none of them. Daniel: "Let's update the POI with sprites of the characters/objects
## at the POI." A tile is 16x24 and the row is 26, so it sits in the row with a pixel to spare and
## the text simply starts further in. A QoL feature (`popupicons`), because Qud's own popup has no

# How wide the message may get before it wraps. MEASURED, not derived, and the difference matters.
# `PopupMessage.SizeContentToWidth` caps the BOX at 840 (MaximumPreferredSize.x), which would leave
# the text 790 — and wrapping there gives an 82-column line where Qud draws 77. Qud's own Message
# element measures 739.20 on a message long enough to fill it (uiprobe, the security door), so that
# is the number: the text wraps at 739.20 / 9.6 = 77 columns and the box takes the longest line
# that results. The 840 cap is real but is not what bites first -- something narrower wraps the
# text before it can reach it, and the prefab's own width is the likely candidate.
#
# UNDERDETERMINED BY ONE SAMPLE, stated so nobody re-derives it from thin air: wrapping this
# message at 77, 78 or 79 columns all produce Qud's 3 lines with a longest of 77. 77 is chosen
# because it is the width Qud reports, not a fitted number. The test pins Qud's measured box

## The Qud dialog frame, hung off THE BOX (see the box-model block above) rather than
## drawn inside a panel. Everything here is box-local, so the negative offsets are real:
## the fill starts 20 above the box and the top rule 16 above it, which is exactly the
## thing that made "the popup sits 16px low" look like a constant to add.
##
## The rule's own pattern is Qud's `polat frame reverse header` strip: a fixed 176-wide
## ornamented centre (872..1048 on screen, i.e. ±88 of screen centre) between two plain
## lines that stretch with the box. Since Qud centres the box, the notches always land on
## the same absolute columns -- gaps at cx±70 (6 wide) and cx (10 wide), measured
## identically on the 278-wide item popup and the 650-wide wish popup.
## Qud's box, as an offset from where Godot put the carrier.
##
## Derived from SIZES ONLY. A Control's `position` is not readable from inside its own
## draw callback -- both `position` and `global_position` come back (0,0) on the show
## frame, and since nothing dirties the panel afterwards that stale draw is the one left
## on screen (this is the same trap that once put the context divider through the item
## name). Sizes ARE valid there, and the placement is reproducible without reading it:
## a CenterContainer puts the child at (parent - child)/2 and Godot FLOORS every Control
## rect to a whole pixel. Confirmed on two popups whose centring lands on opposite sides
## of a half pixel -- 279 wide -> x820 (820.5 floored) and 278 wide -> x821 (exact).

## Source Code Pro's advance, as a FRACTION. Qud lays this text out at exactly 0.6em --
## every width the probe reports is 9.6 * len at font 16 (211.21 for a 22-character row,
## 115.20 for "[Esc] Cancel") -- but Godot's `get_string_size` returns a whole number, so
## the same row measures 212, and summing the per-run pieces of a coloured string rounds
## again and reaches 213. Those 1.8px are not cosmetic: the box is sized off the widest
## row, so they made it 280 wide against Qud's 278.21 and moved its centred left edge, the
## top rule, the divider and the item name a whole pixel with it.
##
## Taking the pitch from the font rather than hardcoding 9.6 keeps it true if the face or
## the size changes. Same reasoning as the journal header, which takes its pitch from the
## width Qud ships rather than from a constant.
## THE ONE CONCESSION IN THIS PORT, and it is a rounding, not a fit. Qud lays its box out
## in subpixels (278.21 wide, left edge 820.895); Godot snaps every Control rect to a whole
## pixel, so Raves has to choose 278 or 279. Left to itself a Container CEILS -- a row
## asking for 228.2 is handed 229 -- and the box came out 279, whose centred left edge is
## 820 where Qud's 278.21 rasterises from 821. Rounding Qud's own value to the NEAREST
## pixel instead reproduces the pixel Qud lands on, and it does so on all four probed
## popups: 278.21->278 (x821, Qud 821), 239.81->240 (x840, Qud 840), 433.61->434 (x743,
## Qud 743), 650->650. Never round a POSITION here -- only the model's own widths, once,
## where Godot would otherwise round them for us in the wrong direction.
## Greedy word wrap at `cols` columns, applied per already-split line. Qud's text is monospaced and
## TMP breaks on words, so a line fills until the next word would overrun and then breaks. A word
## longer than the whole column count is left over-long rather than split, which is what TMP does
## with an unbreakable run. Explicit newlines are preserved — they arrive as separate entries.
