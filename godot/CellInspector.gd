class_name CellInspector

## Point at a cell, get a report you can hand straight to a collaborator (human or
## AI) instead of describing what you see in words.
##
## The report pairs the two things that matter and that can disagree:
##   WIRE     — exactly what Qud sent for that cell (tiles, colours, flags)
##   RENDERED — what ZoneRenderer actually did with each object, and at what Y
## Every rendering bug so far has lived in the gap between those two.
##
## It also resolves each tile to its exported PNG on disk, with dimensions and
## the opaque-row band, so tiles can be decoded directly without a screenshot.
##
## Controls:  Ctrl/Cmd + Left-click, or hover and press I
##            - / =  shrink or grow the panel text   (Esc dismisses)
##
## Output (all three, so it's there however you want to grab it):
##   - on-screen panel
##   - the clipboard
##   - <tilesDir>/../selection.txt   (latest)  and  selections.log  (history)

# getting in the way." So look mode reuses the MARKER and leaves the panel shut until asked.
#
# It also replaces the Look button's old job. That button drove QUD's Looker — a legacy screen Raves
# does not mirror, which the game could not be talked out of (measured: neither Esc, nor
# CmdEscape, nor a second press; the Looker reads raw keys and ignores commands), so the button had
# to send a raw Escape to undo itself. This is the same affordance without the trap.
