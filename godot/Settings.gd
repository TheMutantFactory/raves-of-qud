## them before any UI builds. OptionsScreen reads/writes via get_value/set_value + save();
## the per-view defaults (full_info, camera, bridge host/port) are read by their own
## components (MainFrame, CameraRig, BridgeClient) via get_value at init.

## USER MODE STARTS AS A 1:1 CLONE — Daniel, 2026-08-12: "Let's copy all the 1:1 settings to
## usermode. We'll load back in features 1 at a time."
##
## User mode had accumulated its own shape screen by screen, and testing it meant meeting those
## divergences one surprise at a time: a save name under Continue that Qud does not show, an
## in-game field Qud does not have, a "turn on viewport" step left over from before the 1:1 flow
## existed. Each was defensible alone and the pile was not, because nothing said what the pile
## contained — 55 call sites across 16 files, and no list of them anywhere.
##
## So the DEFAULT flips. A surface asks `qud_shape()` and gets Qud's form in both modes; a QoL
## feature comes back only when it is named here and switched on, which makes the set of
## divergences a list you can read instead of a thing you discover.
##
## `feature` is that name. Unnamed sites can never opt out, which is deliberate for now: they are
## the ones nobody has argued for yet.
## name -> [label, default]. EVERY entry is a divergence from Qud someone chose on purpose, and
## being in this dictionary is what makes it choosable rather than merely present. Off by default:
## user mode starts as a 1:1 clone and features are loaded back one at a time.

## WHERE USER MODE STOPS CLONING 1:1 — the two questions, and they are NOT the same question.
##
## User mode renders as a 1:1 CLONE of Qud and diverges only where a QoL feature says so. So a
## surface asking "do I take Qud's shape here?" is really asking one of two things, and the answer
## in user mode differs:
##
##   qud_shape("msglog")   Qud's shape UNLESS that feature has been loaded back — it HAS a
##                         user-mode form, and this is what selects between them.
##   clone_of_qud()        identical in both modes, by decision — there is no user-mode form.
##
## They used to be one call with an optional argument, and the bare form was the trap: with no
## feature it can never be false in user mode, so an `else` hanging off it was unreachable in BOTH
## modes. Three features were written, shipped and unreachable that way (the message log's grouping,
## Nearby's larger icons, row 4's user-mode heights) — each read as a deleted feature and was only
## a dead branch. The feature name is now REQUIRED, so the ambiguous form cannot be written at all,
## and the decision is legible in the call itself rather than in a comment beside it.

	return true           # user mode: Qud's shape until told otherwise

## "This surface is Qud's shape in BOTH modes." An assertion, not a shortcut — say it only where
## there is genuinely no user-mode alternative. If you find yourself wanting an `else` here, what
## you actually want is a QoL feature: register it in QOL_FEATURES and call qud_shape(name), which
## is the one path that makes a user-mode form reachable (and puts it in Options and presets for
## free, since both enumerate the registry).

	# CONSTANT TRUE, and deliberately so: both modes are Qud's shape here, which is the whole claim.
	# It stays a call rather than becoming an `if true` at 48 sites because it is the ONE lever if

	# made. qud_shape(feature) is the only gate that can answer false in user mode.
