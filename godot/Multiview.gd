## mode, all sharing the main 3D world, so every view can be compared at once (differential testing).
## Toggle with `0` or the ` debug menu; click a pane to inspect that tile through that pane's camera.
##
## Stage 2 of the Main.gd decomposition. Depends only on the CameraRig (for the per-pane placement math)
