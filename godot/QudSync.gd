## RESYNC WITH QUD (F5) — the escape hatch for a state-transition divergence.
##
## Raves infers its scene from the bridge: MainFrame watches bridge_status.txt and falls back to
## the title after three dead reads. That inference is right for the common cases and WRONG at
## every transition Qud handles with a screen of its own. Abandoning a character is the one that
## bit: Qud raises the tombstone (game summary) and stops running a game, Raves sees the bridge go
## quiet, assumes "game over -> title", and the two windows now disagree with no way back except
## clicking around in Qud.
##
## The fix is not more inference. The mod ALREADY reports Qud's real state once a second into
## qud_state.json — `live` (is a game actually running) plus `scene`, the raw _ActiveGameView
## string. Raves simply never read it. This autoload does:
##
##   * `live` decides where Raves BELONGS — it is the authoritative fact, not a guess from silence.
##   * `scene` is REPORTED, never matched against a hardcoded table of Qud view names. We know
##     "MainMenu" and "Stage"; anything else is named to the player verbatim, so a screen we have
##     never seen (tombstone, high scores, a future one) produces a useful message instead of a
##     wrong branch. This is deliberate: the tombstone's view id could only be learned by killing
##     a character, and a tool for rescuing lost states must not itself depend on a lucky guess.
##   * when Qud sits on a screen Raves cannot mirror, it offers Qud's OWN dismissal (`uiback`,
##     the first-party back command — Qud's modern screens ignore synthesised keys).
##
## Deliberately MANUAL. Auto-following Qud would fight the player during ordinary menu use and
## re-enter the game the instant a snapshot arrived; the divergence is rare and the recovery
## should be something the player asks for and can see the result of.

## MAKE A BACK STICK. `uiback` is fire-and-forget, and every Raves overlay that mirrors a Qud
## screen opens in a RACE with the screen it will later back out of: picking the item in the
## mirrored popup tells Qud to open that screen ASYNCHRONOUSLY. Close Raves' copy quickly enough
## and the back lands BEFORE Qud's screen is up — it dismisses whatever was there instead, the
## screen then appears, and Qud sits on something the player already left. Measured on Control
## Mapping: a close 0.4s after opening loses the race every time, a close after 1.5s never does.
##
## So read it back. Watch Qud's own report and re-send while it is still, or newly, on `screen`.
## Bounded to `tries` sends over ~3s, stopping the instant Qud moves or `abort` says to.
##
## A command sent to another process is not done because you sent it; it is done when its state
## changed. This is the one place that rule is implemented, so every sender gets the same
## behaviour and the same log.
