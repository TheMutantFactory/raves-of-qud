    //  VERIFIED against the installed 1.0 build by reflecting Assembly-CSharp.dll
    //  (exact signatures, not string guesses):
    //    - XRL.The.ActiveZone / The.Player
    //    - Movement command IDs "CmdMoveN/S/E/W/NE/NW/SE/SW" (Commands.xml)
    //    - XRL.World.CommandEvent.Send(actor, command, target, cell, standoff,
    //        forced, silent, handler) — no 2-arg overload; pass nulls/defaults.
    //    - GameObject.GetPart<T>(), HasPart<T>(), AddPart(IPart)
    //    - Per-turn hook: pooled XRL.World.EndTurnEvent (has static .ID). See BridgePart.

        //         sprite literally named "horizstripetexture" (THE command-bar scanlines), and a
        //         full-screen "Creases" uses a "creases" grunge sprite. Flatten a stripe image to a
        //         solid chrome-dark quad; hide a grunge overlay (alpha 0).
