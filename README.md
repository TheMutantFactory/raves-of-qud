# Raves of Mud — a Godot 3D / 2.5D viewer for Caves of Qud

A **2.5D / 3D augmentation layer for [Caves of Qud](https://www.cavesofqud.com/)**. It does
*not* reimplement the game. A real, paid, modded copy of Qud runs as the authoritative
simulation; an in-game C# mod publishes what the player sees each turn over a localhost
socket, and a Godot 4 client renders it as a lit 3D scene (greedy-meshed walls, billboarded
sprites, oriented fences) with an orbit/pan/zoom camera. Input round-trips back to Qud, which
resolves every turn.

The player-facing 3D/2.5D view is **the Holodeck** — one component; other user interfaces
(menus, character/inventory, and so on) are separate. ("Holodeck" is the product name; Godot's
API terms — `get_viewport()`, `SubViewport`, "the Godot viewport" — stay as-is in code.)

> Requires your own paid copy of Caves of Qud. Ships **no** game assets — tiles are extracted
> at runtime from your own install into a local, git-ignored folder.

Qud owns worldgen, AI, combat, items, saves, tiles — everything. This repo owns two mappings:
Godot input → Qud command, and Qud zone state → 3D scene.

## What you need

- A **paid, installed copy of [Caves of Qud](https://www.cavesofqud.com/)** with local C# scripting mods
  allowed. Raves ships **no** game assets — tiles are extracted at runtime from your own install into a
  git-ignored folder.
- **Godot 4.7** — the tested path. Other Godot 4.x versions may work but are not the compatibility
  contract. (Built and tested on macOS; the mod compiles in-process, so no Windows build is needed.)
- Optional **.NET SDK** to type-check the mod against Qud's assembly before a restart.

## Quickstart

**macOS quickstart** (the tested path; adjust the mod path on Windows):

```bash
# 1. Deploy the bridge mod (it compiles at Qud startup — a mod change needs a full restart).
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.FreeholdGames.CavesOfQud/Mods/RavesOfQudBridge/
cp mod/*.cs mod/manifest.json \
  ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.FreeholdGames.CavesOfQud/Mods/RavesOfQudBridge/
# 2. Launch Qud; enable the mod + "allow local C# scripting mods"; load a save.
# 3. Verify the bridge is live (the mod opens the socket on the first turn):
nc -z 127.0.0.1 48710 && echo "bridge up"
# 4. Open godot/ in Godot 4.7 and press Play — it auto-connects to 127.0.0.1:48710 and retries until Qud answers.
```

Environment paths and the dev loop: [Running it](#running-it) and `CLAUDE.md`.

## What you can do today

Render the current zone as a lit 3D/2.5D scene (voxel walls, billboard sprites, oriented fences); orbit/
pan/zoom with **7 camera modes** + a multi-view grid ([docs/cameras.md](docs/cameras.md)); move and act
with input round-tripped through Qud; **inspect any tile** (Ctrl/Cmd-click) to compare wire-vs-rendered;
and use a **1:1 Qud-style menu** with Mods/Options screens (a live options mirror + save/load presets).
Day/night, per-cell lighting, water/bridges, and the message/target/effects panels track Qud each turn.

## Limitations

Single-player viewer of **your own** local game — multiplayer is a [proposal](docs/multiplayer.md), not
implemented. macOS is the built/tested platform (a Windows branch exists). The bridge is **localhost-only
with no authentication** — never expose port 48710. Dev-run Godot windows look soft on Retina; export a
build for crisp text.

## Documentation map

This README is the **front door** (above) plus a deep **engineering reference** (below). Detailed
subsystems have canonical homes in `docs/` — prefer those; the reference below is the reverse-engineering
record:

| page | what |
|---|---|
| **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)** | Holodeck boot chain, components, panels, the **threading model**, platform constraints, tile extraction, the bridge cadence. |
| **[docs/rendering.md](docs/rendering.md)** | the 3D render pipeline — classification, **voxel walls**, shading, day/night, lights, fill, overrides. *Start here for anything visual.* |
| **[docs/cameras.md](docs/cameras.md)** | camera modes (**canonical**), the multi-view picker, and viewer controls. |
| **[docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md)** | the wire format — normative summary, snapshot & command frames, fields, colours + palette, water. |
| **[docs/qud-api.md](docs/qud-api.md)** | verified Qud namespaces + signatures (reflection-confirmed). |
| **[docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md)** | the Python inspection tools, the in-viewer inspector/report/screenshots, `control.py`/`desktop.py`, option presets, and the **Python-first workflow**. |

| **[docs/client-in-unity.md](docs/client-in-unity.md)** | **ecosystem port** — build a Raves client in **Unity** against the same engine-agnostic bridge (socket, classification, tiles, colour, input in C#). |
| **[docs/client-in-unreal.md](docs/client-in-unreal.md)** | **ecosystem port** — the same client in **Unreal Engine 5** (FSocket, USTRUCT parse, ISM walls, image-wrapper tiles). |
| **[docs/migrating-clients.md](docs/migrating-clients.md)** | **portable-vs-engine-specific** split, a Godot↔Unity↔Unreal concept crosswalk, port order, and the protocol-versioning rules for multiple clients. |

> **Python-first, for anyone (human or AI) picking this up:** geometry/pixel algorithms (voxel heights,
> fill rules) are **prototyped and verified in Python first** (`tools/capture/voxel.py`, `fill.py` — they
> mirror the GDScript exactly), then ported — because that makes them deterministic and testable without
> a running window. Final lighting/appearance is verified from **captured Holodeck screenshots** (the
> apps screenshot themselves; highvisor can also capture the window). The product is
> well-documented GDScript; Python is validation. See [docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md).

## Running it

### Environment (macOS, this is where it was built)
- Game install: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Caves of Qud/CoQ.app`
  (native macOS **IL2CPP** build). Runtime C# mods compile in-process via the game's bundled
  Roslyn, so **no Windows/PC build is needed** — it all runs on the Mac.
- Mods folder: `~/Library/Application Support/com.FreeholdGames.CavesOfQud/Mods/`
- Assembly: `CoQ.app/Contents/Resources/Data/Managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll`
  (retains source-file path metadata → clean, navigable ILSpy).
- Moddable XML: `CoQ.app/Contents/Resources/Data/StreamingAssets/Base/`
  (`Commands.xml`, `Colors.xml` are real; **`ObjectBlueprints.xml` on disk is a 67-byte stub** —
  the real blueprint/tile data lives in the packed Unity bundles).
- `.NET SDK` via Homebrew: `dotnet` at `/opt/homebrew/bin` (may need
  `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"` in non-login shells).
- Crash log: `~/Library/Logs/Freehold Games/CavesOfQud/Player.log`

### Deploy the mod
```bash
cp mod/*.cs mod/manifest.json \
  ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.FreeholdGames.CavesOfQud/Mods/RavesOfQudBridge/
```
In-game: enable the mod and **allow local C# scripting mods**. Qud auto-applies mod code.
**Changing a mod `.cs` requires a full Qud restart** (mods compile at startup). Changing a
Godot `.gd` only needs re-running the scene.

### Run the client
Open `godot/` in Godot 4.x and press play. It auto-connects to `127.0.0.1:48710` and retries
once a second until Qud is listening (the mod opens the socket on the first turn).

### The live loop
Qud runs (backgrounded is fine) as the server. Godot is the only window you need to watch.
Move with arrows/numpad in **either** — commands round-trip through Qud so the sim resolves
combat/doors/AI exactly as a keypress would.

## Architecture, threading & the wire

- **Holodeck architecture** — boot chain, `Main.gd` decomposition, the MainFrame chrome, panels, the
  direction picker, the **threading model** (turn thread vs main thread; graphics only via `uiQueue`), the
  macOS platform constraints, and the tile-extraction pipeline → **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)**.
- **The wire protocol** — snapshot + command frames, the normative summary, per-cell/per-object fields,
  colours, water → **[docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md)**.
- **Verified Qud API reference** — namespaces + signatures, reflection-confirmed → **[docs/qud-api.md](docs/qud-api.md)**.

## Qud data model & mappings

The full reverse-engineered data model (verified against the live 1.0 build by reflection + capture) now
lives in the subsystem docs. The load-bearing facts, and where each is documented in depth:

- **A cell is NOT just its objects.** Qud paints a ground layer (dirt/grass) onto ~1103/2000 cells that hold
  no GameObject; the mod sends it as a RenderLayer-0 floor at the bottom of each cell's stack.
  → [protocol.md](docs/protocol.md), [rendering.md §2](docs/rendering.md).
- **Accessors, not fields.** `Render.getTile()` / `getRenderString()` resolve runtime-chosen art; the
  `.Tile` / `.RenderString` *fields* are static blueprint values (empty for `PickRandomTile` etc.).
  → [protocol.md](docs/protocol.md), [decisions](docs/decisions/debugging-lessons.md).
- **Colour model.** `ColorString` = `&FG^BG`; `_qud_color` takes the **foreground** (the half before the
  `^`). Tiles are 2-colour masks: black→`TileColor`, white→`DetailColor`, transparent→the world
  background. The 16-char palette ships live in every snapshot (`k`=#0f3b3a, the world's dark teal — **not**
  black). → [protocol.md Colours + palette table](docs/protocol.md#colours), [rendering.md §3](docs/rendering.md).
- **Tile geometry (16×24).** A top-down **cap** over a south **front-face**; the split is not at row 16 and
  varies by family (`_wall_split`; measure from the isolated `-00000000` variant, never `-11111111`).
  → [rendering.md §3–4](docs/rendering.md).
- **Autotiling.** Walls/water carry an 8-bit neighbour bitmask (`-XXXXXXXX`); fences/pipes carry a
  `{n,s,e,w}` connection set (`_connector_dirs`). → [rendering.md §1, §4](docs/rendering.md).
- **RenderLayer → classification.** The `layer` field (+ `wall` / `occluding`) decides flat-floor vs prism
  vs billboard. → [protocol.md RenderLayer values](docs/protocol.md), [rendering.md §1](docs/rendering.md).
- **Water & bridges are first-class Qud concepts** — `Cell.HasWadingDepthLiquid()` / `HasBridge()`, not
  tile-name inference. The render rule: keep the water **flat**, recess the actor (`sinks` = `IsCreature &&
  !IsFlying`, cropped at the waterline; a bridge cancels the sink and decks over the water).
  → [protocol.md Water & bridges](docs/protocol.md#water--bridges), [rendering.md §6](docs/rendering.md).

The hard-won *why* behind each — the grass mystery, the trailing-letter colour bug, the `CAMERA_BACKGROUND`
turquoise trap, the wading-depth control — is in
[docs/decisions/debugging-lessons.md](docs/decisions/debugging-lessons.md).

## Rendering & tools

The 3D render pipeline — object classification, the painted ground layer, colour/fill, the **voxel walls**,
lighting (the world honours `SHADED_WORLD`, currently on), day/night + sun/moon, water/bridges, and user
overrides — is documented in full in **[docs/rendering.md](docs/rendering.md)**. The Python inspection tools
and the in-viewer feedback loop (Ctrl/Cmd-click → `selection.txt`; F12 screenshots) are in
**[docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md)**.

## Open problems / next steps

Done since the early drafts: deep water/bridges, tents-as-panels, the painted ground layer,
per-family user overrides (shape/fill/position), the real palette + day/night + sun/moon, **voxel
walls**, and the Python-first verification workflow. What's left:

**Voxel walls** — the flush-and-carve model shipped and looks right (see
[docs/rendering.md §4](docs/rendering.md#4-voxel-walls--flush-surface--carved-gaps)). Largely done:
- Faint cell-seam phase can still differ between autotile variants; chase with `snap.py` if it shows.
- `MultiMesh` per (variant, mesh, rotation) if per-cell instance counts hitch at render radius.

**World model / streaming** — see [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the current status. The
persistent `WorldStore` pivot has **shipped**: snapshots are ingested into a per-zone store keyed by
`gameId`, explored zones persist to disk, and remembered neighbours render dimmed. Remaining work is an
adjustable render radius, eviction/budgets, ground-plane growth, and later stacked strata — the spine
for fog of war, memory freeze/unfreeze, Z-height, cross-zone distance, and a future block-editing fork.
Hierarchy: world of parasangs; parasang = 3×3 zones; zone = 80×25 cells; plus Z-strata.
- Each snapshot is a full zone rebuild, but the client already **freezes static geometry** and rebuilds
  only the dynamic layer per turn (per-step render ~85ms → a few ms). The remaining cost is the
  full-zone serialize on the mod side; measure with the profiler (F9) before optimizing further.

**Rendering polish**:
- Sprites/floors don't cast or receive shadows (only walls + ground do). Shadows on the ground
  from a sprite would need the sprite shaded.
- `SINK_WADE`/`SINK_SWIM` are eyeballed; no swim animation or waterline ripple; the crop edge is hard.
- Possible double-drawn ground: `DirtPath`/`DirtFloor` dots sit on cells that also carry a painted
  ground tile, both RenderLayer 0. Check for z-fighting / redundancy.
- Sun/moon are tint-drivers + sky discs; no directional shadows from the moon, no visible-body arc
  unless the camera tilts low.

### Working style that paid off
Ground every change in real data (reflect the DLL, capture a live snapshot, decode a tile) rather
than guessing; appearance is verified from captured screenshots, so the loop is **compile-harness →
deploy → user re-runs → capture/screenshot → adjust**. Keep the Qud-coupled surface small and
isolated so a Qud update is a quick re-verify, not a rewrite.
